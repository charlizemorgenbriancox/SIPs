## Simple Summary
<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the SCCP.-->
It is proposed to update the composition of the sDEFI index synth. The DeFi space moves quickly. The index tracking DeFi should reflect the rapid pace of innovation and development.

## Abstract
<!--A short (~200 word) description of the variable change proposed.-->
The proposal is to add YFI, UNI, NXM and CRV to sDEFI while removing ZRX, REP, LRC and BNT. The community has voted on the following initial weightage of the index:
  - 15.00%	YFI
  - 15.00%	AAVE
  - 15.00%	SNX
  - 10.00%	UNI
  - 7.50%	COMP
  - 7.50%	MKR
  - 5.00%	NXM
  - 5.00%	UMA
  - 5.00%	REN
  - 5.00%	KNC
  - 5.00%	BAL
  - 5.00%	CRV

## Motivation
<!--The motivation is critical for SCCPs that want to update variables within Synthetix. It should clearly explain why the existing variable is not incentive aligned. SCCP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->
The purpose of the updated sDEFI index synth is to attract traders wishing to gain exposure to the burgeoning DeFi sector with one token. YFI, UNI, NXM and CRV are tokens of projects advancing the capabilities of every user in the DeFi space. YFI enables industrialized liquidity mining farming and custom asset management strategies at scale. Uniswap is the most decentralized piece of software enabling trustless swaps of ERC20 tokens with Ether or other ERC20 tokens. Nexus Mutual writes insurance policies enabling users to hedge the risk of DeFi smart contract failures. Curve is the most liquid stablecoin swap venue, enabling users to convert sUSD, USDT, USDC or DAI to a different flavor of stablecoin. Each of these tokens represents a project at the cutting edge of what is possible in DeFi.
