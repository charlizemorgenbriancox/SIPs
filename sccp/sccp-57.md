## Simple Summary
<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the SCCP.-->
As part of the Pollux deployment and transition to Chainlink Oracles the fee reclamation window was set to 5 minutes to monitor the network for the potential to frontrun oracle updates. This sccp proposes to reduce the window back to 3 minutes.

## Abstract
<!--A short (~200 word) description of the variable change proposed.-->
This SCCP proposes to reduce the fee reclamation window to 3 minutes.

The changes proposed are listed below:

2. SystemSettings.waitingPeriodSecs: 3mins x 60 = 180s

## Motivation
<!--The motivation is critical for SCCPs that want to update variables within Synthetix. It should clearly explain why the existing variable is not incentive aligned. SCCP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->
The monitoring of Chainlink oracles shows that it would be sufficient to mitigate frontrunning opportunities with a fee reclamation window of 3 minutes. The Chainlink team has worked to ensure that price deviations are updated within the reclamation window.

The current fee reclamation window was set to 5 minutes in [SCCP-43](.sccp-43.md) to monitor the Chainlink oracles and was intended at the time to eventually reduce the window back to 3 minutes as soon as possible.

A lower fee reclamation window improves the UX for traders trading on Synthetix exchange and other synth exchange products on L1.
