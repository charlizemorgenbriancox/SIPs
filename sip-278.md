## Simple Summary

Allow users to nominate during the voting period.

## Motivation

Community members have expressed concern that legitimate candidates miss the nomination period for a given council election, and end up not running for election. 

This has resulted in quality candidates missing governance epochs, which is an increasing problem in periods of low governance participation, particularly when it comes to the TC or meta-governance votes for the SC.

Nomination and voting periods were created as separate periods due to spamming concerns. Some SC and community members have discussed that spamming doesn't seem to be a concern given the gas fee paid for nominating. No spamming incidents on any of the previous nomination periods support this position.  

## Overview
Participants running for council will be able to nominate during the voting period. 

## Specification
Pending a comment from Ale

## Test cases
A new election gets called. An initial nomination period starts as usual, where it is not possible to vote. After the initial nomination period, the voting period will start and users will still have the ability to nominate.
