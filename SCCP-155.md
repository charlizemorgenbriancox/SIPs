## Simple Summary

This SCCP proposes to increase the Ambassador Council seats to four members (currently there are 3). 

## Motivation

Through out the previous Epoch the ambassadors have faced some challenges when it comes to coordination around the various timezones of the members. On more than one occasion the ambassadors were unable to sign transactions with the Embassy multi-sig on short notice, due to conflicting timezones which make it so that there are few time slots where all 3 members are available. These coordination failures have resulted in the Ambassadors being unable to fulfill some of our obligations.

### Rationale

The ambassador council is centred around a multi-sig which is currently 3/3, (a 2/3 multisig is not ideal for security) this means that all three members must be available in order for any transaction to be signed. Further more all three ambassadors need to coordinate and reach consensus before voting on any proposal or signing any transactions. If there is sufficient notice the ambassadors can execute their duties, however if there is a matter that's short notice or time 
sensitive, there is a possibility of being unable to fulfil those duties.

In less urgent scenarios, a three member council makes it difficult to have more than one ambassador present at townhall events and community AMAs (again due to conflicting timezones). These scheduling difficulties are amplified when trying to coordinate with other DAOs for community calls in discord or twitter. 

Further, the Ambassador Council has come to mature this Epoch with a clearer mandate and direct collaboration on some public proposals which benefit the ecosystem. With the introduction of delegation incentives and the collecting of data from these initiatives, it's become clear that there is a need for a technical role within the ambassador council (see SIP 157: there was a previous clause excluding any expectation of technical skills related to smart contracts). The addition 
of technical roles in the ambassador council means that the ambassadors need a more diverse set of members to nominate them selves for the role. 

With the addition of the 300-community during this epoch, we believe that there will be more competition in the upcoming elections. In order to be encouraging of new community members to nominate them selves and not be intimidated by a small candidacy list, we think it's ideal to increase the number of seats on the ambassador council to four members.
