## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

This SIP establishes the Aelin Protocol.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the SIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the SIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

This SIP proposes the creation of the Aelin Protocol, Aelin is an open and permissionless set of factory contracts that enables anyone to instantiate a pool of capital that can be used to source deals within the Ethereum ecosystem.

## Motivation

<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the SIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the SIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is innaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the SIP will address the issue!-->

Aelin is a new decentralised deal coordination protocol. This SIP leverages the established decentralised governance framework of Synthetix to launch this new protocol in a fair and transparent manner. A portion of the AELIN tokens will be distributed to SNX stakers as a sign of appreciation for the effort that has gone into Synthetix governance enabling Aelin to launch via this SIP.

Establishing a new protocol and community is a challenging proposition, there are very few examples of projects that have been fair launched and managed to become self-sustaining. By leveraging the exisiting Synthetix governance process and rewarding SNX stakers Aelin will be able to create a new governance system that inhereits the legitimacy of Synthetix governance. The decision to leverage Synthetix governance relied on the past success of Thales and Kwenta in establishing independent communities.

## Specification

<!--The specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature, there are five sections
1. Overview
2. Rationale
3. Technical Specification
4. Test Cases
5. Configurable Values
-->

### Overview

<!--This is a high level overview of *how* the SIP will solve the problem. The overview should clearly describe how the new feature will be implemented.-->

The Aelin contracts have been written by a team of volunteer engineers. It will be up to Aelin governance to decide whether to utilise funds from the AelinDAO to reward these efforts. The contracts will be deployed once this SIP has been approved by the Spartan Council after they have been audited.

The purpose of these contracts is to create a new protocol that satisifies the following high level specification:
Aelin enables (a Sponsor) to create a pool that anyone (purchaser) can deposit funds into. In exchange for their deposit they get a token representing a claim on the pool of funds. The sponsor then structures a deal with a counterparty (the Holder). The Sponsor and the Holder formalise the deal terms in a Deal Contract. Once the terms are finalised, conversions are enabled between the pool contract and the deal contract. aePool token holders can choose to redeem their aePool tokens for the underlying funds in the pool, rejecting the deal terms. Alternatively, they can redeem their aePool tokens under the terms of the deal. The protocol collects a fixed percentage of each deal determined by protocol governance, 2% initially. The Sponsor can also elect to capture a percentage of the deal in addition to this protocol fee. In both cases, these fees are paid in tokens under the deal terms.

### Rationale

<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs. The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

Over the last few years the crypto fundraising process has matured significantly. We see far fewer huge pre-product raises. Most seed rounds are in the low single digit millions. The issue is that this means it is almost impossible for the wider community to participate in early stage projects. There are solutions such as LBPs by Balancer and other projects, but Aelin will allow for a project to launch a new token with a fixed outcome in terms of valuation without needing to negotiate with thousands of people or relying on a market driven mechanism that may result in a highly variable outcome. Using Aelin a pre-token project will be able to find a sponsor with a pool of funds that meets their funding needs and negotiate a resonable valuation with vesting terms that ensure long term alignment. Additionally for established projects OTC deals that help generate treasury liquidity will be possible resulting in much wider token distribution.

### Technical Specification

<!--The technical specification should outline the public API of the changes proposed. That is, changes to any of the interfaces Synthetix currently exposes or the creations of new ones.-->

**Factory Contract**

The factory contracts allow anyone to initialise a new aePool contract and then a Deal Contract.

_aePool Contracts have the following variables:_
|Pool Variables|
|---------|
|Pool name (aePool-name)|
|Pool token symbol (aeP-symbol)|
|Purchase Token (Dai, sUSD, USDC, wETH, WBTC, etc)|
|Purchase Token Cap: Cap in token (0 for uncapped. Uncapped deals are proRate)|
|Duration: period after which aePool tokens can be redeemed for the Purchase Token. When a deal is presented the aePool tokens may also be redeemed if the purchaser does not want to participate|
|Sponsor Fee % (Optional - set from 0 up to 98%)|
|Purchase Expiry: period after which pool tokens are no longer purchasable|

_Deal Contracts have the following variables:_
|Deal Variables|
|---------|
|Deal name (aeDeal-name) - name is inherited from the pool|
|Deal token symbol (aeD-symbol) - symbol is inherited from the pool|
|Underlying deal token (YFI, SNX, AAVE, UNI, CRV, essentially any ERC-20 token)|
|Underlying deal Ratio (Deal Token/Purchase Token Ratio)|
|Underlying deal token total - how many Deal tokens in total are available in the offering|
|Pro-rata redemption period: An initial period in which purchasers can claim their pro rata portion of the deal|
|Open redemption period: At the end of the pro rata period, if necessary, anyone who claimed their full pro rata share can continue to redeem the rest of their pool tokens for any unredeemed deal tokens based on the number of purchasers who opted out. This period only exists if the pro-rata share of pool ownership is less than 1:1|
|Vesting Period: Time before all underlying deal tokens are released which starts from the end of the vesting cliff|
|Vesting Cliff: Time before underlying deal token begins vesting|
|Vesting curve: Initially linear but could be more complex in future versions|
|Holder: the holder of the underlying deal token entering into an agreement with the sponsor who negotiates on behalf of the purchasers|

**User Journeys**

_Sponsor Journey_

1. aePool Contract Creation

   1. Sponsor creates an UNCAPPED (0 cap) pool with a NAME and SYMBOL for the token
   2. Sponsors inputs USDC as PURCHASE TOKEN
   3. Sponsor inputs one month as PURCHASE EXPIRY
   4. Sponsor inputs six months as DURATION
   5. Sponsor inputs 2% as SPONSOR FEE

2. Deal negotiation

   1. Sponsor approaches Holder to purchase XYZ token
   2. Sponsor agrees to $20m USD of XYZ
   3. 20% discount to spot
   4. Six month cliff and six month linear vesting

3. Deal Contract Creation
   1. Sponsor inputs UNDERLYING DEAL TOKEN XYZ
   2. Sponsor inputs UNDERLYING DEAL TOKEN TOTAL
   3. Sponsors inputs UNDERLYING DEAL TOKEN to PURCHASE TOKEN RATIO (XYZ/USDC) (1/250)

_Purchaser Journey_

1. Purchase

   1. Purchaser sends 500 USDC
   2. Purchaser receives 500 aePool tokens

2. No Deal Case (DURATION elapses before deal announced)

   1. Six month redemption window expires
   2. Purchaser calls redeem on contract and burns 500 aePool tokens for 500 USDC

3. Deal Accepted

   1. Sponsor announces deal

### Test Cases

<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for SIPs but can be included with the implementation..-->

Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for SIPs but can be included with the implementation.

### Configurable Values (Via SCCP)

<!--Please list all values configurable via SCCP under this implementation.-->

All variables will be configurable once Aelin governance is established by AELIN token holders.
