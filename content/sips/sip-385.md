## Simple Summary
This SIP introduces a fee-sharing mechanism for Perps v3 deployment on Arbitrum, where liquidity providers earn 40%, the protocol's treasury earns 40%, and integrators earn 20% of the base fee in Synthetix's native Arbitrum stablecoin. The proposal also instructs the Treasury Council to bridge the protocol's earned fees to Base to be used for the buyback and burn mechanism of SNX as per [SIP-345](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-345/).

## Abstract
This SIP proposes a fee-sharing mechanism for liquidity providers, the protocol's treasury, and integrators of the Synthetix Perps v3 deployment on Arbitrum. Liquidity providers will earn 40% of the fees, integrators will earn a 20% fee for trades processed through their integration, and the remaining 40% will be earned by the Synthetix treasury to be used to buy back and burn SNX on the Base chain. All fees will be distributed in Synthetix's native Arbitrum stablecoin. Future products or networks will require additional proposals to set the integrator fee share.

## Motivation
This fee distribution model follows a proven model already in place on Synthetix's Base deployment, where we're seeing a continually growing total value locked by liquidity providers, enabling increasing trading volumes by front-end integrators. The SNX buy-back and burn mechanism on Base has proven effective for channeling value to SNX holders during the interim period of isolated chain deployments, and as such can also be applied to fees captured on Arbitrum.

## Specification
Integrators will request a unique tracking code for each integration they wish to track and provide an address to which they will receive fees. A 20% fee relative to protocol fees earned, excluding gas, execution fees, or funding fees, will be directed to the corresponding address for all trades executed using an integrator tracking code.

The Treasury Council will periodically bridge earned protocol fees to the Base network, swap for USDC, and send them to the SNX Buyback contract as per [SIP-345](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-345/).

## Rationale
Having a consistent and transparent fee structure across chains is key to attracting and retaining liquidity providers, integrators and Synthetix tokenholders alike.
