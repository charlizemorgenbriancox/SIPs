## Simple Summary
This SIP introduces a universal fee-sharing mechanism between LPs, integrators and protocol.

## Abstract
Introduce a fee-sharing mechanism for liquidity providers, the protocol's treasury, and integrators of the Synthetix Perps v3 deployment on any existing and future chain. Liquidity providers will earn 40% of the fees, integrators will earn a 20% fee for trades processed through their integration, and the remaining 40% will be sent to Synthetix Treasury to hold onto for distribution to SNX stakers as instructed by Spartan Council in near future. 

## Motivation
This fee distribution model follows a proven model already in place on Synthetix's Base deployment, enabling increasing trading volumes by front-end integrators.

## Specification
Configure a Fee collector for Perps Market on each chain where Perps v3 is deployed to collect SNXFeeShare = 50% of net fees (after integrator share)
Fee Collector accrues USD denominated fees

Integrators will request a unique tracking code for each integration they wish to track and provide an address to which they will receive fees. A 20% fee relative to protocol fees earned, excluding gas, execution fees, or funding fees, will be directed to the corresponding address for all trades executed using an integrator tracking code.

## Rationale
Having a consistent and transparent fee structure across chains is key to attracting and retaining liquidity providers, integrators and Synthetix tokenholders alike.
