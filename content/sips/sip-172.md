# Simple Summary

This proposal seeks to elevate the current Synthetix Governance System from V2 to V3, introducing two new governance structures (Core Contributor Committee & Treasury Committee), addresses pain-points identified in Governance V2 (first iteration of delegated governance), proposes to shift responsibilities around and defines meta-governance processes to improve the efficiency and self-autonomy of the Synthetix DAOs.

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the SIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the SIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

# Abstract

If this proposal is approved and adopted, the following subsets of the Synthetix Governance system will be implemented

- Ratify the Core Contributor Committee
- Deprecate the Synthetix DAO (sDAO) and establish the Treasury Council
- Amalgamation of related governance tools and websites into one dedicated Governance dApp
- Create a formal specification of the election and nomination timelines and processes
- Formally address meta-governance processes and issues that have been identified

<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the SIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the SIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is inaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the SIP will address the issue!-->

# Motivation

Since the introduction of [SIP-93](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-93) which ratified the Spartan Council and paved the way for the establishment of the grantsDAO and ambassadorDAO. The protocol has been able to decentralize a majority of its decision-making responsibilities into separate governance bodies.

However, there still exists some governing bodies that are still yet to be transitioned to be in-line with the new decentralized governance of the Synthetix Protocol. These bodies still have privileged roles that are not decided in the same democratic way that the existing DAOs are. A portion of this SIP aims to finalize this transition by ratifying a Core Contributor Committee and Treasury Council.

The remainder of this proposal then addresses the cumbersome problems discovered in the Governance V2 mechanisms such as the:

- Nomination, elections and hand-off processes of the DAOs
- Transparency and accessibility of governance debates and discussions
- Review and executions of SIPs/SCCPs
- Coordination between the DAOs, especially the Spartan Council and the Core Contributors

Which have historically been addressed according to discretion and experimentation.

# Specification

<!--The specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature, there are five sections
1. Overview
2. Rationale
3. Technical Specification
4. Test Cases
5. Configurable Values

- State the process per DAO that must happen each election, including the transfer of NFTâ€™s and/or multisig ownership
- What happens when a nominated user rejects a seat (who gets it, how is this managed)
- Multisigs with less than 5 owners need a backup signer (maybe pdao or CC or SC)
- What happens when there are less nominees then there are positions?
