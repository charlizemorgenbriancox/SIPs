## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

This SIP proposes burning fees collected by the fee pool on instead of allowing them to claim the fees and have it transferred to them. This will have the effect of reducing user's debt overall, and in theory they will be able to mint more at a later date.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the SIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the SIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

As we continue to shift more stakers to L2, and to ensure the incentives are aligned for stakers to remain on L2, we need to change our current strategy for distribution of fees. To meet this, we propose burning any collected fees at the beginning of the fee period and distributing $0 in fees as rewards. This will also have the effect of equitably sharing fees equally with undercollateralized users and users who forget/do not claim, since their debt would simply decrease. This changes is appealing because (at least from the smart contract perspective) this change is easy to implement.

## Motivation

<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the SIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the SIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is innaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the SIP will address the issue!-->

With the recent surge in fees generated by atomic swaps, it is important that L2 stakers continue to receive the most benefits on L2 despite the volume being on L1. Additionally, as we continue to encourage stakers to migrate to L2, this provides additional incentive to make sure the rewards are at least even.

After we fully complete the L1 migration to L2, this method of fee distribution will already be correct and we wont have to make any additional changes to the protocol to ensure all fees are sent to L2.

## Specification

<!--The specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature, there are five sections
1. Overview
2. Rationale
3. Technical Specification
4. Test Cases
5. Configurable Values
-->

### Overview

<!--This is a high level overview of *how* the SIP will solve the problem. The overview should clearly describe how the new feature will be implemented.-->

The SIP will make changes to the fee pool on both networks:
* In `FeePool`, in `closeFeePeriod`, add a call to call issuer `burnSynthsWithoutDebt` to burn all the sUSD in the fee address.
* In `FeePool`, in `closeFeePeriod`, reduce `feesToDistributed` equal to `feesToDistribute`.
* In `FeePool`, in `claimFees`, remove/update any logic corresponding to sUSD fee distribution.

Amount of excess `sUSD` is calculated by: `_recentFeePeriodsStorage(0).feesToDistribute * SynthetixDebtShare.totalSupply() /  _recentFeePeriodsStorage(0).allNetworksDebtSharesSupply`.

### Rationale

<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs. The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

A previous iteration of this SIP discussed distributing a portion of the collected sUSD rewards to L2 using the new sUSD bridge. However, its difficult to send funds back to L1 so this would stop working if L2 started generating more fees than L1 proportionally. It was also discussed manually adjusting the amount transferred to L2 using SCCP, but this would add a lot of overhead on the council and ultimately what we want is the most equitable distribution of fees possible, since everyone shares the debt pool equally.

### Test Cases

<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for SIPs but can be included with the implementation..-->

Unit tests
* `FeePool`
  * `closeFeePeriod`
    * ADD check that `Issuer.burnSynthsWithoutDebt` is called
    * EXISTS change tests to expect fees to be already claimed (because they were burnt)

### Configurable Values (Via SCCP)

<!--Please list all values configurable via SCCP under this implementation.-->

None
