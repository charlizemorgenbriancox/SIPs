## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

This SIP proposes changing the sUSD fee distribution to send additional sUSD to L2. The amount will be proportional to the amount of SNX on L2.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the SIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the SIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

As we continue to shift more stakers to L2, and to ensure the incentives are aligned for stakers to remain on L2, we need to change our current strategy for distribution of fees. To meet this, we propose sending an additional amount of sUSD from L1 to L2 using the synth bridge upon fee pool closure. This amount will be based on the amount of SNX staked on L2. Fees generated on L2 will remain on L2, only L1 is sending a portion of its fees. In both cases, sUSD rewards are incentivized towards L2 over L1. Thankfully, we already have all the tools in the protocol to be able to change the distribution with minimal engineering effort.

## Motivation

<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the SIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the SIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is innaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the SIP will address the issue!-->

With the recent surge in fees generated by atomic swaps, it is important that L2 stakers continue to receive the most benefits on L2 despite the volume being on L1. Additionally, as we continue to encourage stakers to migrate to L2, this provides additional incentive.

After we fully complete the L1 migration to L2, this method of fee distribution will already be correct and we wont have to make any additional changes to the protocol to ensure all fees are sent to L2.

## Specification

<!--The specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature, there are five sections
1. Overview
2. Rationale
3. Technical Specification
4. Test Cases
5. Configurable Values
-->

### Overview

<!--This is a high level overview of *how* the SIP will solve the problem. The overview should clearly describe how the new feature will be implemented.-->

The SIP will make a few contract changes:
* In `SynthetixBridgeToOptimism`, allow `FeePool` to call `initiateSynthTransfer` without initialization.
* In `FeePool`, in `closeFeePeriod`, add a call to transfer the amount of excess `sUSD` to L2 fee address.
* In `FeePool`, in `closeFeePeriod`, reduce `feesToDistribute` for upcoming fee period by amount of excess `sUSD`.
* In `FeePool`, in `closeSecondary`, add a parameter to take in the amount of excess `sUSD` to L2. Call `recordFeePaid` with this amount.

Amount of excess `sUSD` is calculated by: `_recentFeePeriodsStorage(0).feesToDistribute * SynthetixDebtShare.totalSupply() /  _recentFeePeriodsStorage(0).allNetworksDebtSharesSupply`.

### Rationale

<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs. The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

We could also divert all fees from L1 to L2, but this seems a bit to aggressive of a change for the moment considering we do not yet have debt position migration.

### Test Cases

<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for SIPs but can be included with the implementation..-->

Unit tests
* `FeePool`
  * `closeFeePeriod`
    * ADD check that `initiateSynthTransfer` was called with correct amount (or similar)
    * ADD check that new fee period has reduced fees to L1
    * EXISTS verify cross chain message emitted with correct amount
* `SynthetixDebtShare`
  * `initiateSynthTransfer`
    * CHANGE allows `FeePool` to call always
    * EXISTS test proper events emitted

Dual integration Tests
* EXISTS test fee pool close cross chain
* ADD test that all fees are sent to L2 if there are no stakers on L1
* EXISTS test synth transfer sUSD

### Configurable Values (Via SCCP)

<!--Please list all values configurable via SCCP under this implementation.-->
