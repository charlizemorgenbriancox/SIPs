## Simple Summary

The sip proposes to put in place a dynamic gas fee module, which is able to adjust the `minKeeperFee`, within bounds set by governance. Note that the `updateMinKeeperFee` function is a publically callable function that doesn't require any endorsed address for execution.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the SIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the SIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

The dynamic gas fee module is a standard [Gnosis Safe Module](https://help.safe.global/en/articles/4934378-what-is-a-module) that is able to alter the `minKeeperFee` in our [`PerpsV2MarketSettings`](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x649F44CAC3276557D03223Dbf6395Af65b11c11c) within bounds specified in the contract and configurable via governance:
- The calculation steps of the minKeeperFee is as follows (detailed example below):
 1) `costOfExecutionGross := (gasPriceL2 * gasUnitsL2 + l1BaseFee * (gasUnitsL1+overhead) * feeScalarL1) * ETH/USD`
 2) `profitMargin := max(profitMarginUSD; costOfExecution * profitMarginPercent )`
 3) `costOfExecutionNet := costOfExecutionGross + profitMargin`
 4) `minKeeperFee := min( max(costOfExecutionNet, minKeeperFeeLowerBound) ; minKeeperFeeUpperBound)`
- The `ETH/USD` price is obtained with the on-chain chainlink ETH oracle
- The profit margin is incorporated in order to absorb shocks to gas prices on the one hand and to incentivize a decentralised keeper network
- The lower and upper bounds on the `minKeeperFee` are incoporated for safety purposes
- The number of gas units required on L1 and L2 are configurable via SCCP
- `overhead`, `gasPriceL2`, `gasPriceL1` and `feeScalarL1` can be all queried on-chain with the help of the [gasPriceOracle](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x420000000000000000000000000000000000000F#readContract)

## Motivation

The main motivation is the recent surge and volatility in gas prices which has resulted in all the decentralized keepers to be outpriced and the need to update the `minKeeperFee` in order to bolster the network of decentralized keepers that ensure that orders are executed without delay.

Note that the spartan council can enable/disable the Dynamic Gas Fee module by simply instructing pdao to remove the module's ability to update the `minKeeperFee` and this can be triggered out of the box with the existing gnosis safe. 

## Specification

### getMinKeeperFee:
This is a getter public function that returns computed gas price given on-chain variables

### setMinKeeperFee:
This is a publically callable function that updates the `minKeeperFee` in PerpsV2MarketSettings

### getParameters:
This is a getter public function that returns the current configurations specified under the  Configurable Values section.

### setParmeters:
This can only be called by the owner (pdao on optimism), whereby the variables specified under the Configurable Values section, can be updated.

### Test Cases

#### Gas Price Module Configurations:
- `profitMarginPercent`: 20%
- `profitmarginUSD`: 2 sUSD
- `minKeeperFeeUpperBound`: 10 sUSD
- `minKeeperFeeLowerBound`: 2 sUSD
- `gasUnitsL1` : 26,900 GAS
- `gasUnitsL2` : 1.2e6 GAS

#### On-chain Gas Price Values:
- `l1BaseFee` : 92 GWEI/GAS (found under [gasPriceOracle](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x420000000000000000000000000000000000000F#readContract) in wei)
- `l2GasPrice` : 0.001 GWEI/GAS (found under [gasPriceOracle](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x420000000000000000000000000000000000000F#readContract) in wei)
- `scalar`: 1 (aka dynamic_overhead, found under [gasPriceOracle](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x420000000000000000000000000000000000000F#readContract) after incorporating the decimal adjustment found in the same contract)
- `overhead`: 2,100 GAS (found under [gasPriceOracle](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x420000000000000000000000000000000000000F#readContract))
- `ETH/USD`: 1,869$

#### `minKeeperFee` Computations:
- `costOfExecutionGrossGwei` = (0.001 * 1.2e6 + (26,900 + 2,100) * 92 * 1) = 2,669,200 GWEI
- `costOfExecutionGrossETH` = 2,669,200 / 1e9 = 0.0026692 ETH
- `costOfExecutionGrossUSD` = 0.0026692 ETH * 1,869 USD / ETH = 4.988 sUSD =~ 5 sUSD
- `profitMargin` = max(2 ; 20% * 5) = 2 sUSD
- `costOfExecutionNet` = 2+5 = 7 sUSD
- `minKeeperFee` = max(min(7;10) ; 2) = 7 sUSD

### Configurable Values (Via SCCP)

- `minKeeperFeeLowerBound` being the lower bound on the minKeeperFee that can be updated
- `minKeeperFeeUpperBound` being the upper bound on the minKeeperFee that can be updated
- `gasUnitsL1` and `gasUnitsL2` being the number of gas units required to execute a pending offchain delayed order
- `profitMarginUSD` being a profit margin in sUSD, applied on the cost of execution
- `profitMarginPercent` being a keeper profit margin in percentage, applied on the cost of execution
