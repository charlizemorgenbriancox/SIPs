## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the SCCP.-->

This sip aims to improving the user experience by allowing users to reduce a position regardless of the margin requirements.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the variable change proposed.-->

The current perps v3 design allows users to decrease an existing open position size, as long as the users' available margin is above the required margin in the [post state](https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix-v3/blob/main/markets/perps-market/contracts/storage/AsyncOrder.sol#L350). This SIP proposes to alleviate this requirement when a user is performing a reduction in the size of an existing open position.


## Motivation

<!--The motivation is critical for SCCPs that want to update variables within Synthetix. It should clearly explain why the existing variable is not incentive aligned. SCCP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->

The main reason is that the perps v3 design does not allow for simultaneous orders to be executed and therefore users could be required to increase their margin before being allowed to reduce their positions. Hence, the need a bypass when a user commits to a change that reduces the size of the open position.

## Specification

<!--The therefore specification should describe the syntax and semantics of new feature, there are five sections
1. Overview
2. Rationale
3. Technical Specification
4. Test Cases
5. Configurable Values
-->

The change done are included in this [PR](https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix-v3/pull/1995).


### Test Cases

<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for SIPs but can be included with the implementation..-->

- Setting an account with 100 sUSD worth of available margin and 2 longs position on ETH and BTC requiring 110$ and 30$ worth of margin respectively:
    - When the account passes a 10$ decrease in his BTC position
        - ✅ Then the transaction succeeds
    - When the account passes a 10$ decrease in his ETH position
        - ✅ Then the transaction succeeds
    - When the account attempts to fully close his BTC position
        - ✅ Then the transaction succeeds
    - When the account attempts to increase 10$ worth on his BTC position
        - ❌ The transaction reverts due to not having enough margin
    - When the account attempts to increase 10$ worth on his ETH position
        - ❌ The transaction reverts due to not having enough margin


### Configurable Values (Via SCCP)

<!--Please list all values configurable via SCCP under this implementation.-->
