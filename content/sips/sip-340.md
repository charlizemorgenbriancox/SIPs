## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

This SIP proposes the addition of a `multicallThrough` function and changing all functions to `payable`. This will allow for [ERC-7412](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7412) support for EOAs.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the SIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the SIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

A `multicallThrough` function will be added, which delegates an array of calls to functions in the system in which it has been deployed, as well as any contract addresses added to an allowlist via SCCP. All functions in the system which includes the `MulticallModule` will be made `payable`.

## Motivation

<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the SIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the SIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is inaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the SIP will address the issue!-->

To implement [SIP-329](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-329/) with [ERC-7412](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7412), weâ€™d like to provide a method for constructing a multicall for EOAs. We can't simply create a function that delegates calls to an arbitrary address, as a malicious contract could e.g. execute calls to steal funds from the protocol.

Accordingly we need to add an allowlist for contracts which can be called by the function (configurable via SCCP), which can include oracle contracts relied upon by the protocol. Orace contracts may be payable, requiring a `msg.value`. This creates a further complication, where calls to non-payable functions in a multicall will error if `msg.value` is present (even if it set to 0). This can be resolved by making all functions `payable`, whether or not they rely on `msg.value`.

## Specification

### Overview

<!--This is a high level overview of *how* the SIP will solve the problem. The overview should clearly describe how the new feature will be implemented.-->

Implementation involves the addition of the `multicallThrough` function, a system configuration parameter `_CONFIG_ALLOWLISTED_MULTICALL_TARGETS`, and the change of functions throughout the protocol to `payable`.

### Rationale

<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs. The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

Outside of requiring end users to exclusively use account abstraction/smart contract wallets for multicall construction, we could also explore implementing a trusted forwarder, per [ERC-2771](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2771). This would be a more significant, structural change to the codebase that we'd like to avoid if possible.

### Technical Specification

<!--The technical specification should outline the public API of the changes proposed. That is, changes to any of the interfaces Synthetix currently exposes or the creations of new ones.-->

Note that this change alters the function signatures for those changed to `payable`. It should not be applied to functions in the codebase that adhere to standards, like ERC-20 and ERC-721.

Changing functions to `payable` is a minor gas optimization. See [the discussion here](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13114) for relevant information.

### Configurable Values

- `_CONFIG_ALLOWLISTED_MULTICALL_TARGETS` - An array of addresses that can be set as targets in the `multicallThrough` function.
