## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

This SIP proposes the addition of an [ERC-2771](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2771) compliant trusted forwarder including Multicall3 functionality with error bubbling, which will enable gasless transactions and [ERC-7412](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7412) support for EOAs.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the SIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the SIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

Protocol clients will be able to simulate transactions, gather necessary signed data from decentralized oracle networks (such as prices), and use the functionality proposed in this SIP to create a single transaction that includes the verification and storage of the data necessary to complete a transaction.

## Motivation

<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the SIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the SIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is inaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the SIP will address the issue!-->

To implement [SIP-329](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-329/) with [ERC-7412](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7412), we’d like to provide a method for constructing a multicall for EOAs. Waiting on the Ethereum ecosystem to move to smart contract wallets (per Account Abstraction, [ERC-4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337)) is not viable.

## Specification

### Overview

<!--This is a high level overview of *how* the SIP will solve the problem. The overview should clearly describe how the new feature will be implemented.-->

Implementation involves:

- The deployment of an ERC-2771 compliant trusted forwarder including Multicall3 functionality (which appends `msg.sender` to `msg.data`, like the standard’s `execute` function and adds error bubbling).
- The addition of an [ERC2771Context](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/metatx#ERC2771Context) library to the protocol which references the contract above as the trusted forwarder. (Note that deployment of the trusted forwarder with `CREATE2` guarantees a consistent address for the contract across chains, so it can be hardcoded.)
- The use of `_msgSender` and `_msgData` (from the context library) rather than `msg.sender` and `msg.data`, respectively.

### Rationale

<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs. The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

We previously considered adding a `multicallThrough` function to the `MulticallModule` with an SCCP-configurable list of addresses external to the protocol which it could call. (This list could include oracle contracts, for example.) We opted to present the solution here instead because:

- All functions would need to be changed to `payable` to allow composing payable and otherwise non-payable calls in the multicall. This would be a breaking change, as the function signatures through the codebase would be altered.
- The protocol’s attack surface would become larger, as exploits in the listed external addresses could have detrimental consequences for the protocol.

An added benefit of using a trusted forwarder is that we can take this opportunity to add ERC-2771 compliance, enabling gasless transactions.

### Technical Specification

<!--The technical specification should outline the public API of the changes proposed. That is, changes to any of the interfaces Synthetix currently exposes or the creations of new ones.-->

See draft implementations of the [trusted-multicall-forwarder](https://github.com/Synthetixio/trusted-multicall-forwarder) and the [protocol upgrade](https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix-v3/pull/1817/commits/975c0347ed6d2e4c49ab51d1167871ed716901f7).

A [solhint linter](https://github.com/Synthetixio/solhint-plugins/tree/main/packages/solhint-plugin-meta-transactions) can be used to help avoid mistaken explicit use of `msg.sender` and `msg.data` throughout the codebase.
