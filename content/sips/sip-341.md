## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

This SIP proposes the addition of a configurer address that can execute SCCPs.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the SIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the SIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

The [Router Proxy Architecture](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-307/) involves an owner address which can upgrade the protocol by altering the proxy's implementation address (i.e. executing SIPs) and call permissioned functions in the system to alter configuration (i.e. executing SCCPs). This SIP involves adding a new address which is able to call the permissioned functions but not alter the proxy’s implementation address.

## Motivation

<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the SIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the SIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is inaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the SIP will address the issue!-->

Adding a `configurer` address opens up the design space for on-chain governance. As altering SCCPs should generally entail low risk changes (relative to SIPs), different logic can dictate their control. This also makes it possible to for the protocol to become immutable in the future—the owner of the proxy could renounce ownership, but the configurer could continue to update parameters (which need to remain responsive to dynamic market conditions).

## Specification

### Overview

<!--This is a high level overview of *how* the SIP will solve the problem. The overview should clearly describe how the new feature will be implemented.-->

Implementation involves adding a new `configurer` address to the core, spot market, perps market, and governance systems. This does not need to be added to the oracle manager because it is a stateless system with no configurable values. Then, the validations that determine permissions for configuration updates need to be updated accordingly.

### Rationale

<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs. The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

The proposed implementation continues to allow the owner address to execute SCCPs. Because this address can effectively replace code that would prevent it from executing these functions, adding such a restriction would not increase security. Also, this pattern makes use of the configurer address optional.

### Technical Specification

<!--The technical specification should outline the public API of the changes proposed. That is, changes to any of the interfaces Synthetix currently exposes or the creations of new ones.-->

- Add a `configurer` variable to storage.
- Create an `onlyOwnerOrConfigurer` function which references this value and replace calls to `OwnableStorage.onlyOwner()` where appropriate.
- Create a `setConfigurer` function that can only be called by the system owner.
- Add a `nominateConfigurer` and `acceptConfigurer` function, such that the configurer (and only the configurer) can transfer its status to another address.

### Configurable Values

- `configurer` - The configurer address, which can be set to the zero address by default.
