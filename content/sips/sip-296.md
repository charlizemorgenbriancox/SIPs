## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

This SIP proposes adding the Otex [cowswap](https://swap.cow.fi/#/10/swap/_) solver contracts to the Direct Integration Manager.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the SIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the SIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

As outlined in [SIP-267](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-267/), every new Direct Integration needs to be specified in a sip along with the parameters proposed for that integration. Therefore this sip proposes to allows otex to trade at the overridden parameters mentioned below, whereby a short 1 block latency is embedded due to the user-keeper path required. 


## Specification

The below parameters would be specified on the otex contracts:
-  `0xCe419fEE26C7E567f925189AAE9F934BC9AE4F2d`
