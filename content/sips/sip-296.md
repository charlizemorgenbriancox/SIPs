## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

This SIP proposes adding the Otex [cowswap](https://swap.cow.fi/#/10/swap/_) solver contracts to the Direct Integration Manager.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the SIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the SIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

As outlined in [SIP-267](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-267/), every new Direct Integration needs to be specified in a sip along with the parameters proposed for that integration. Therefore this sip proposes to allows otex to trade at the overridden parameters mentioned below, where the CRV <> SNX Atomics <> CRV path is guaranteed by otex's on-chain contracts. 


## Specification

The following parameters would be specified on the otex contracts:
-  `ADDRESS_HERE`

```
{'currencyKey': 'sUSD',
 'dexPriceAggregator': '0x228bCc970003Ca7588337604AFD9Fc5d92bF1C8B',
 'atomicMaxVolumePerBlock': 5m$,
 'atomicExchangeFeeRate': 0}

{'currencyKey': 'sETH',
 'dexPriceAggregator': '0x228bCc970003Ca7588337604AFD9Fc5d92bF1C8B',
 'atomicMaxVolumePerBlock': 5m$,
 'atomicVolatilityUpdateThreshold': 10,
 'atomicExchangeFeeRate': 5 bp}
