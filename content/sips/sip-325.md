<!--You can leave these HTML comments in your merged SIP and delete the visible duplicate text guides, they will not appear and may be helpful to refer to if you edit it again. This is the suggested template for new SIPs. Note that an SIP number will be assigned by an editor. When opening a pull request to submit your SIP, please use an abbreviated title in the filename, `sip-draft_title_abbrev.md`. The title should be 44 characters or less.-->

## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

This SIP proposes adding a new multicall function which can be used with core system functions such that the value of `msg.sender` can be preserved.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the SIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the SIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

Currently, the multicall module contains a function similar to the standard [Multicall3 contract](https://www.multicall3.com/). Batched contract calls recognize the multicall contract’s address as `msg.sender` when using this function, rather than the calling address. We can avoid this issue by creating a multicall function that stores the calling address to storage and then have the protocol reference this value rather than `msg.sender` directly in the code.

## Motivation

<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the SIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the SIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is inaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the SIP will address the issue!-->

A design principle of the V3 system has been to keep singular concerns for each public function. We assume that complex user actions can be composed with a series of function calls in a multicall. Accordingly, the addition of this function should allow for a wider range of functionality to be composed for end users.

Further, with the implementation of [SIP-329](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-329/), we anticipate the need for all of the protocols’ functionality to be accessible via multicall, such that fresh price data can be prepended to arbitrary calls.

## Specification

See [here](https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix-v3/blob/f153b4fba8cd7d6f9cadd7b580132b465db80008/protocol/synthetix/contracts/modules/core/MulticallModule.sol#L40) for a preliminary implementation of the function. The system will need to reference the `_CONFIG_MESSAGE_SENDER` value (rather than `msg.sender`) throughout the codebase and reset this value when functions are being called without the multicall.

### Test Cases

<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for SIPs but can be included with the implementation..-->

Test cases will be developed during implementation.

SCCP switched to `Rejected` as per author's request

### Configurable Values (Via SCCP)

<!--Please list all values configurable via SCCP under this implementation.-->
