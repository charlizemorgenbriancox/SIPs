## Abstract

SIP-386 proposes to list all remaining active markets from perps v2 on perps v3

## Motivation

Perps V3 on Base has seen significant growth since its deployment and has scaled effectively. With the fee rebate incentives now live, 
it's a good time to ensure that the incentive program has maximal impact with as many markets available to trade as supported by v2 on optimism.

## Specification

list the following markets on perps V3: AAVE, ADA, ALGO, APT, ATOM, AXS, BAL, BCH, BLUR, COMP, CRV, DOT, DYDX, EOS, ETC, ETHBTC, FIL, FLOW, FXS, GRT, ICP, IMX, JTO, JUP, LDO, LTC, MATIC, MEME, NEAR, PYTH, RNDR, SEI, SHIB, STRK, SUSHI, TRX, UNI, XLM, XRP, YFI


## Configurable Values (Via SCCP)

- the activation of listed markets
- market parameters
- risk configurations
