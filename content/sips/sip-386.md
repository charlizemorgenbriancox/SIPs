## Abstract

SIP-386 proposes to list all remaining active markets from perps v2 on perps v3

## Motivation

Perps V3 on Base has seen significant growth since its deployment and has scaled effectively. With the fee rebate incentives now live, 
it's a good time to ensure that the incentive program has maximal impact with as many markets available to trade as supported by v2 on optimism.
