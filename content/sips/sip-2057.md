## Simple Summary

The sip proposes to put in place a new dynamic gas fee module which replaces the one currently implemented under [SIP-2055](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-2055/). The new module would incorporate the necessary changes in transaction costs associated with optimism's [fjord upgrade](https://docs.optimism.io/builders/notices/fjord-changes). Depending on governance, optimism is expected to update their gas pricing mechanism on July 10th at 16:00:01 UTC. Therefore, this sip would be implemented immediately following that update.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the SIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the SIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

The dynamic gas fee module is a standard [Gnosis Safe Module](https://help.safe.global/en/articles/4934378-what-is-a-module) that is able to alter the `minKeeperFee` in our [`PerpsV2MarketSettings`](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x649F44CAC3276557D03223Dbf6395Af65b11c11c) within bounds specified in the contract and configurable via governance:
- The calculation steps of the minKeeperFee is as follows (detailed example below):
 1) `costOfExecutionGross := (l2GasCost + l1GasCost) * ETH/USD`
 2) `profitMargin := max(profitMarginUSD; costOfExecutionGross * profitMarginPercent )`
 3) `costOfExecutionNet := costOfExecutionGross + profitMargin`
 4) `minKeeperFee := min(costOfExecutionNet ; minKeeperFeeUpperBound)`
- The `ETH/USD` price is obtained with the on-chain chainlink ETH oracle
- The profit margin is incorporated in order to absorb shocks to gas prices on the one hand and to incentivize a decentralized keeper network
- The  upper bound on the `minKeeperFee` is incorporated for safety purposes
- Computation of `l2GasCost`and `l1GasCost` are detailed below.

## Motivation

The main motivation is to continue to incentivize the decentralized community keepers to execute perps v2 settlement & liquidation transactions by covering the cost of execution.

## Specification

The following functions would be incorporated into the new [contract](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xc7BA0f1DE31627Ad655684Cd347260eb7a815e78#code):

### getMinKeeperFee:
This is a getter public function that returns computed gas price given on-chain variables

### setMinKeeperFee:
This is a publicly callable function that updates the `minKeeperFee` in PerpsV2MarketSettings

### getParameters:
This is a getter public function that returns the current configurations specified under the  Configurable Values section

### setParameters:
This can only be called by the owner, whereby the variables specified under the Configurable Values section, can be updated

### setPaused:
Allows to pause and unpause the gnosis module

### Owner
Returns the owner of the module that can pause the module


#### L1 Gas Cost:
As per the [fjord](https://specs.optimism.io/fjord/exec-engine.html#fees) specification, the L1 gas cost can be estimated with the helper function,`getL1FeeUpperBound` , which facilitates the on-chain computation. Hence that function would be used, feeding it with an SCCP configurable value `unsignedTxSize`.

Hence, the following would be used to infer the l1 gas costs:
`l1GasCost = getL1FeeUpperBound(unsignedTxSize)`

#### L2 Gas Cost:
The L2 Gas cost calculation remains unchanged and is obtained by fetching the relevant l2GasPrice (`block.baseFee`) and multiplying it by a configurable value `l2GasUnits`.

### Test Cases

#### Gas Price Module Configurations:
- `profitMarginPercent`: 20%
- `profitMarginUSD`: 1 sUSD
- `minKeeperFeeUpperBound`: 30 sUSD
- `unsignedTxSize` : 3500
- `l2GasUnits` : 1.35e6 GAS

#### On-chain Gas Price Values:
- `l2GasPrice`: 0.005 GWEI/GAS
- `ETH/USD`: 2500$

#### Min Keeper Fee Calculation:
- `l1GasCost = getL1FeeUpperBound(3500) = 3500 GWEI`
- `l2GasCost = 0.005 * 1.35e6 = 6750 GWEI`
- `costOfExecutionGrossGwei = 3500 GWEI + 6750 GWEI = 10250 GWEI`
- `costOfExecutionGrossUSD = (10250/1e9) ETH * 2500 USD/ETH ~= 0.025 sUSD`
- `profitMargin = max(1 ; 20% * 0.025) = 1 sUSD`
- `costOfExecutionNet = 1+0.025 = 1.025 sUSD`
- `minKeeperFee = min(1.025;30) = 1.025 sUSD`

### Configurable Values (Via SCCP)

- `minKeeperFeeUpperBound` being the upper bound on the minKeeperFee that can be updated, (set to 30 sUSD)
- `unsignedTxSize`  size of the unsigned fully [RLP-encoded transaction](https://sepolia-optimism.etherscan.io/getRawTx?tx=0x6b614d3dd27c66b98f83055108509a8fcdaf9cc2924878345cb49ac3d91e338b) for settling an offchain delayed order.
- `gasUnitsL2` being the number of gas units required to settle an offchain delayed order 
- `profitMarginUSD` being a profit margin in sUSD, applied on the cost of execution, (set to 1 sUSD)
- `profitMarginPercent` being a keeper profit margin in percentage, applied on the cost of execution, (set to 20%)
