## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

Update the snx liquidation functionality, laid out in [SIP-148](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-148/), to allow for the following:
- SNX escrow entries can be liquidated to restore an account back to target staking ratio
- Update the flag and liquidation reward mechanism as to vest snx, in order to pay for flagging/liquidation when a user does not hold enough snx in his account

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the SIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the SIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "We propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

The new `Liquidator` contract should allow both SNX tokens held in an account as well as escrow entries to be liquidated until the target issuance ratio of a snx staker is restored. In case an account does not hold enough snx to restore back to the target issuance ratio, then the stakers' account is closed with debt cleared and all the snx in the account is sent for other stakers to claim. If the self-liquidate method is called, a user's account is liquidated with **only** the snx available in his account (escrow cannot be utilized to repay debt with the self-liquidation method).

## Motivation

<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs? The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

The reasoning behind this SIP, is that accounts can circumvent the intention of [SIP-148](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-148/) by not vesting their escrow entries, and therefore have a free open-ended put option on their debt. Allowing for escrow entries to be liquidated helps restore network collateralization ratio, as the debt would shift to other stakers, who acquire the escrowed entries and take on the delinquent debt.
There is currently around 2.8m$ worth of debt between optimism and ethereum, backed by 1.4m worth of escrowed SNX, which can't be liquidated because of restrictions on liquidations of escrowed entries. With the changes proposed in this sip, that debt would be wiped clean allowing the protocol to be more resilient and better capitalized in the long run.

### Overview

<!--This is a high level overview of *how* the SIP will solve the problem. The overview should clearly describe how the new feature will be implemented.-->
The main workflow of the liquidation contract is as follows:
1) Flag and Liquidation Mechanism, describing the incentives that result in accounts being flagged and liquidated.
2) Liquidation Workflow, describing the liquidation mechanism with the different scenarios that could arise.

#### Flag and Liquidation Mechanism

The flag/liquidation incentive scheme is mostly identical to the one specified in [SIP-148](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-148/), with the followings additions:
- A flagged account immediately gives up snx to the flagger. Whereas, in the SIP-148 implementation, flagger receives a reward only upon liquidation.
- In the situation where the delinquent account holds more snx than the flag/liquidation reward, the flagger/liquidator receives these rewards into his account directly from the snx available in the delinquent stakers account.
- In the situation where the account being flagged or liquidated does not hold enough snx in his account, but holds enough escrowed snx entries, the flagger/liquidator receives rewards  from the delinquent account, and the remaining amount needed to cover the reward amount is obtained by vesting the most recent entries of the delinquent account. Any excess snx that are vested are restored to the stakers account with new entries that have the same expiry as those previously vested to pay the flagging  or liquidation reward.
- The flagged account does not hold enough snx to pay the flagging  or liquidation reward. The account is closed (i.e. all debt is cleared) and the snx available (if any) is vested immediately or sent to the account calling flag/liquidate. Note in this situation, in case the staker has pending snx that are yet to be claimed (from other liquidations) that escrowed snx can still be claimed by the staker at a later date and is not used to pay the flagger or liquidator. 

The above workflow precedes the computation related to the liquidation event, meaning a staker could lose more snx than the amount necessary to cover debt, since flagger/liquidator receives the reward first. 

##### Liquidation Workflow

###### Self-Liquidation
A user can call the self-liquidation functionality at any time his account drops below the collateralization ratio. The following situation can arise upon self-liquidation call:
1) The user holds enough snx (not escrowed snx) to restore the target issuance ratio. The user calls self-liquidates and the snx available in his account is used along with penalty imposed to restore the collateralization ratio to the target issuance ratio (equation 1 in calculation methodology section).
2) The user does not hold enough snx in his account to restore the target issuance ratio, but holds some snx. Upon calling self-liquidate, all the snx available in his account is used to repay as much debt as possible, taking into account the self-liquidation penalty (equation 2).
3) The user does not hold any snx in his account (but has escrow entries) and calls the self-liquidate functionality. The transaction reverts.
4) The user is above the target issuance ratio and calls the self-liquidate. The transaction reverts.

###### Liquidation
As mentioned in SIP-148, a liquidation method can be called after the `minLiquidationDelay` runs out, the below scenarios can arise:
1) The user holds enough snx to restore the target issuance ratio. The user is liquidated, with the snx available in his account and a liquidation penalty is imposed (equation 1).
2) The user does not hold enough snx to restore the target issuance ratio, but holds enough snx + escrowed entries to restore to the target issuance ratio. The user is liquidated, with the snx available in his account utilized to repay debt, the remainder is obtained by immediately vesting the most recent entries available, restoring the collateralization ratio to the target issuance ratio. If the entries vested hold more snx than required to repay debt, then a new entry with the excess snx and is added to the account with the same vesting period as the future-most entry used for liquidation.
3) The user does not hold enough snx in his account or in escrow to restore his collateralization ratio to the target issuance ratio. Upon liquidation call, the debt is cleared and all the snx in the account are immediately vested and paid to stakers.
4) The user is above the target issuance ratio and liquidate is called. The transaction reverts.
5) The `liquidationDelay` has not run out and liquidation method is called. The transaction reverts.

###### Calculation Methodology

The below variables are used to describe the components of the liquidation computations:
- V = Value of SNX and Escrow Entries in USD terms
- D = Debt Balance
- t = Target Collateral Ratio
- S = Amount of debt to settle
- P = Liquidation Penalty %
- L = Value of SNX liquidated in USD terms

1) Account holds enough SNX to restore to the target staking ratio, the following is used to compute the debt to be settled, specified in [SIP-15](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-15/):

\\[
S = \frac{t * D - V}{t - (1 + P)}
\\]

\\[
L = S * (1+P)
\\]

2) Account does not hold enough SNX to restore to the target staking ratio, the following is used upon self-liquidation call, specified in [SIP-240](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-240/):

\\[
S = V*(1 + P)
\\]

### Rationale

<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs. The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

The following points are points are worth mentioning pertaining to the implementation:
- The fundamental reason behind not allowing for self-liquidation of escrow funds, is that it provides a way to sell escrowed snx immediately for debt relief. The penalty imposed in such a case might not compensate stakers  for the uncertainty around SNX price and the time horizon required for liquidation rewards to vest.
- Upon liquidation / self-liquidation, the SNX relinquished by the delinquent account can be claimable by snx stakers with a `liquidationEscrowDuration` before the snx is vested. SNX Escrow entries that are used for liquidation are deleted. In other words, if an entry with 6 month duration is used to settle debt, it transforms to a `liquidationEscrowDuration` entry that can be claimed by stakers that take on the delinquent debt. 
- Similar to the implementation in SIP-148, SNX is claimable by the stakers on the same chain where the liquidation event took place. Stakers on the other chain are compensated for the liquidation with pDAO receiving the snx needed to compensate the other chain from the weekly inflation print and adding escrow entries to stakers that were staking at the time of the liquidation event.
- The account merge methodology is deprecated due to the changes required on `RewardEscrowV2` and in order to simplify the implementation.
- Only in the event of a staker is above the target issuance ratio, is the liquidation flag removed.  In other words, calling self-liquidate when an account is flagged does remove the flag if the staker is not back to the target issuance ratio.

### Technical Specification
<!--The technical specification should outline the public API of the changes proposed. That is, changes to any of the interfaces Synthetix currently exposes or the creations of new ones.-->

### Test Cases

<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for SIPs but can be included with the implementation..-->

#### Test Cases on Flagging

- Given that a staker's collateralization is below the `liquidationRatio`, is not flagged and a flag reward of 4 snx
    - When an account attempts to flag the staker
      - Given the staker has 5 snx in his account and 2 escrow entries of 1 snx and 3 snx with expiries of 5 days and 10 days respectively
        - ✅ Then it succeeds and the following take place:
            - 4 snx is sent from the staker to the flagger
    - Given the staker has 1 snx in his account and 2 escrow entries of 1 snx and 3 snx with expiries of 5 days and 10 days respectively
        - ✅ Then it succeeds and the following take place:
            - 1 snx is sent from the staker
            - The snx entry expiring in 5 days is vested immediately and sent to the flagger (i.e. 1 snx)
            - The snx entry expiring in 10 days is vested immediately:
                a) 2 snx is sent to the staker
                b) 1 snx is added as a new escrow entry with vesting in 10 days
    - Given the staker has no snx in his account and 2 escrow entries of 1 snx and 2 snx with expiries of 5 days and 10 days respectively
        - ✅ Then it succeeds and the following take place:
            - The snx entry expiring in 5 days is vested immediately and sent to the flagger (i.e. 1 snx)
            - The 2 snx entry expiring in 5 days is vested immediately and sent to the flagger (i.e. 1 snx)
            - The stakers' debt is cleared as it holds no more snx
    - Given that a staker's collateralization is above the `liquidationRatio` and is not flagged 
        - When an account attempts to flag the staker
            - ❌ Then it reverts, due to the address not being below the liquidationRatio
    - Given that a staker's collateralization is below the `liquidationRatio` and is flagged 
        - When an account attempts to flag the staker
            - ❌ Then it reverts, due to the address being already flagged

#### Test Cases on Liquidation 

- Given that the snx price is at 1$, the liquidation ratio is at 150%, target staking ratio of 300%, the liquidation penalty is 40% and the `liquidationReward` is 5 snx
    - When an account attempts to liquidate a staker that is not flagged
        - ❌ Then transaction reverts, due to the address not being flagged
    - When an account attempts to liquidate a staker who is flagged with 100$ worth of debt and 145 snx in his account
        - ✅ Then it succeeds and the following take place:
            - the liquidator receives 5 snx reward
            - the debt is cleared
            - 140 snx is sent to stakers
    - When an account attempts to liquidate a staker who is flagged with 100$ worth of debt and 1 snx in his account and 144 snx in escrow
        - ✅ Then it succeeds and the following take place:
            - the liquidator receives 5 snx reward (1 snx directly from the liquidated staker and 4 snx in vested entries)
            - the debt is cleared
            - 139 snx is sent to stakers
    - When an account attempts to liquidate a staker who is flagged with 100$ worth of debt and 146 snx in escrow
        - ✅ Then it succeeds and the following take place:
            - the liquidator receives 5 snx reward from the vested entries
            - 62.5 cents worth of debt remain and 1.875 worth of snx entries with the future-most expiry
            - 139.125 worth of snx is sent to other stakers to claim
    - When an account attempts to liquidate a staker who is flagged with 100$ worth of debt and 1 snx in escrow
        - ✅ Then it succeeds and the following take place:
            - the liquidator receives 1 snx reward from the vested entries
            - the debt is cleared
            - snx stakers receive nothing
    - When an account attempts to liquidate a staker who is flagged with 100$ worth of debt and holds no snx or escrow entries
        - ✅ Then it succeeds and the following take place:
            - the liquidator receives nothing
            - the debt is cleared
            - snx stakers receive nothing
    - When an account attempts to liquidate a staker who is flagged with 100$ worth of debt and 500 snx in escrow
        - ❌ Then transaction reverts, due to address being above the target staking ratio
