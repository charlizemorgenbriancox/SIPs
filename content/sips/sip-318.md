<!--You can leave these HTML comments in your merged SIP and delete the visible duplicate text guides, they will not appear and may be helpful to refer to if you edit it again. This is the suggested template for new SIPs. Note that an SIP number will be assigned by an editor. When opening a pull request to submit your SIP, please use an abbreviated title in the filename, `sip-draft_title_abbrev.md`. The title should be 44 characters or less.-->

## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

This SIP proposes allowing custom minimum liquidity ratios to be set for specific markets via SCCP.

## Motivation

<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the SIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the SIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is inaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the SIP will address the issue!-->

The core system has a concept of a "minimum liquidity ratio" which determines a maximum amount of credit capacity (i.e the amount of withdrawable stablecoins) for markets relative to the value of the total collateral that has been delegated to them. This is a risk parameter somewhat analagous to the issuance ratio for liquidity providers.

In anticipation of allowing existing integrators—and ultimately anyone—to connect market implementations with the core system, it would be valuable to allow governance to adjust this risk parameter depending on the specifics of a market's behavior.

## Rationale

<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs. The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

In practice, the global, default minimum liquidity ratio will be set to a conservative (high) value. Governance can assess risk mitigation factors implicit in a markets' implementation and use this functionality to reduce the minimum liquidity ratio for a specific market, increasing its capital efficiency.

## Technical Specification

<!--The technical specification should outline the public API of the changes proposed. That is, changes to any of the interfaces Synthetix currently exposes or the creations of new ones.-->

A mapping, `mapping(uint128 => uint) customMinLiquidityRatioD18;`, will be added to the `SystemPoolConfiguration` storage library, with a corresponding setter method. If a non-zero value is present in this mapping for the relevant market, that value will be used in place of `minLiquidityRatioD18`.

### Test Cases

<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for SIPs but can be included with the implementation..-->

Relevant tests will be developed during implementation.

### Configurable Values (Via SCCP)

<!--Please list all values configurable via SCCP under this implementation.-->

This SIP will add a mapping `customMinLiquidityRatioD18` of market ID to a percentage multiplier (1000000000000000000 represents 100%).
