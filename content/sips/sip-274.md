## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

This SIP proposes the creation of an inactivity threshold for the maximum number of protocol-issued votes that can be sequentially missed by a Spartan Councillor before a dismissal request is automatically put to the council owner (currently the pDAO).

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the SIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the SIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

The role of a Spartan Councillor entails using power delegated by SNX stakers to vote on proposed protocol changes (SIPs and SCCPs) so that implementations can be made that optimally advance the Synthetix project. The requirement that Core Contributors abide by only the proposals that are passed by the Spartan Council, and only implement changes once they are passed by a vote, places a great deal of responsibility in the hands of the individual councillors to grant proposals their due consideration and do so in a reasonable timeframe. If voting is hampered by inactivity, this effectively stalls the protocol's ability to implement improvements and, in some cases, make important and time-critical changes. As such, in order to better ensure the protocol's ability to rapidly act in its interests, this SIP proposes the creation of an inactivity threshold that, if exceeded, triggers the automatic dismissal of Spartan Councillors from their role. This inactivity threshold is one established through the measuring of occasions and durations in which a Spartan Councillor has failed to engage in protocol-issued votes.

## Motivation

<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the SIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the SIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is innaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the SIP will address the issue!-->

Conceptually, the intention of this SIP is to ensure that the Synthetix community can anticipate from the Spartan Council an ongoing and reasonable level of attentiveness to a core responsibility of their role. Rather than seeking to mitigate issues that may arise should a single vote need to be be passed quickly, this SIP, by establishing a maximum number of protocol-issued votes that can be missed sequentially, seeks to encourage routinized participation in governance processes and decrease sustained periods of inactivity. It should be noted that what is meant here by protocol-issued votes is those that are authored by Core Contributors or members of the four councils (Spartan, Treasury, Ambassador, Grants). Specifying the authors proposals that suffer missed votes that are counted towards the inactivity threshold is designed to prevent SIP and SCCP votes created without merit unduly influencing the triggering of a dismissal request to the pDAO.

## Specification

<!--The specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature, there are five sections
1. Overview
2. Rationale
3. Technical Specification
4. Test Cases
5. Configurable Values
-->

This SIP proposes that missing five (or more) qualifying votes in a row that meet the below-listed criteria and that have been issued by the protocol will automatically trigger a request to the council owner, currently the pDAO, to dismiss the Spartan Councillor in question. The following conditions should be met when counting the five votes (with the latter two set in the interest of granting the Spartan Council some freedom to disengage for brief periods from online activity):

- A missed vote is one in which a Spartan Councillor has submitted neither a Yes or a No vote prior to its end date

- As previously stated, the votes counted must be authored by CCs or members of the four current councils

- The vote should be announced on project Discord within 24 hours of its creation with the @Spartan Council tag used to alert members

- The votes counted must have a time window in which to vote of no less than three days (72 hours)

- The votes that are counted cannot all fall within a single fee period

- The first and the last votes counted must have started greater than one week apart

Once five qualifying votes have been missed, this can be raised by any member of the Synthetix community, in response to which the Spartan Council is required, upon validation, to submit a request for dismissal to the council owner.

## Rationale

The rationale behind this SIP is the desire to reassure all parties concerned with the Synthetix project that the core governance body behind the protocol will be active and engaged with the governance process that facilitates its development. These parties include users of protocol-issued tokens (such as sUSD), SNX holders, SNX stakers, protocol partners, Core Contributors and members of each of the councils that manage the project, including the Spartan Council itself. Each and every one of the members of these groups benefits from a vibrant governance culture that can only flourish through participation. The goal of this SIP is to encourage this participation and dissuade inactivity at the highest level within the protocol hierarchy, a practice that sets a poor example and diminishes the perceived value of time devoted to furthering the Synthetix project.

## Test Cases

The above image records the state of voting on several SIPs and SCCPs in order to illustrate where a dismissal would be triggered.

- Spartan Councillor 7 missed their first vote on SIP-X, that was begun on 08/29/2022 at 16:26 UTC.

- In order to be dismissed , Spartan Councillor 7 would need to have at least 5 missed votes occur sequentially over a period of greater than seven days.

- Spartan Councillor 7 would thus need to have missed all 8 votes on the table, as SIP-Y marks the first missed vote outside of the 7-day window started with SIP-X. This missed vote would be the one that could trigger dismissal.

- If SCCPs 4 to 6 had not been put to vote, SIP-Y would still trigger Spartan Councillor 7's dismissal, as SIP-Y still brought the sequentially missed votes to a total of five, while also falling outside of the 7-day window begun be SIP-X.
