<!--You can leave these HTML comments in your merged SIP and delete the visible duplicate text guides, they will not appear and may be helpful to refer to if you edit it again. This is the suggested template for new SIPs. Note that an SIP number will be assigned by an editor. When opening a pull request to submit your SIP, please use an abbreviated title in the filename, `sip-draft_title_abbrev.md`. The title should be 44 characters or less.-->

## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

Grant a few special permissions to the `LegacyMarket` contract, the facilitator of the migration of collateral and debt to Synthetix V3.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the SIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the SIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

V3 is imminent! To allow for the smoothest transition possible, a special V3 market called the `LegacyMarket` has been prepared. It allows
for users to migrate their collateral and/or redeem their sUSD to their V3 counterparts, while allowing for V2x to continue

## Motivation

<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the SIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the SIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is innaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the SIP will address the issue!-->



## Specification

<!--The specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature, there are five sections
1. Overview
2. Rationale
3. Technical Specification
4. Test Cases
5. Configurable Values
-->

### `LegacyMarket`

<!--This is a high level overview of *how* the SIP will solve the problem. The overview should clearly describe how the new feature will be implemented.-->

The `LegacyMarket` contract contains a few methods to facilitate transition:

#### `function migrate(uint newAccountId)`

Can be called by any staking account to atomically move their position to V3. This consists of the following broad steps:

* Transfer all SNX (requires special permission) to `LegacyMarket`
* Transfer all debt shares in the user's account to the `LegacyMarket` contract where they will stay
* Wrap all SNX collected from the user into a newly created user account with ID `newAccountId`. Invest in the spartan council fund, which invests in the `LegacyMarket`
* Associate the specific debt for the user to their account on V3

*NOTE: the user still needs to `approve()` the LegacyMarket for their whole balance of SNX before executing.*

#### `function migrateOnBehalf(address target)`

Allows for owner to force migrate any. Functions the same as `migrate()`.

#### `function convertUSD(uint amount)`

Called by any user who owns `amount` sUSD to convert (burn) `amount` sUSD, and mint an equivalent quantity of V3 USD.

This function effectively provides a mechanism of V2x -> v3 *debt* migration.

*NOTE: the user still needs to `approve()` `LegacyMarket` to spend their sUSD.*

### Changes to v2x

In order to support the above functionality, the following changes are required in V2x:
* allow `LegacyMarket` to unconditinoally transfer SNX, even if the user has debt in their account (technically not required but would be helpful)
* prevent any liquidations on V2x once `LegacyMarket` address is set
    * the idea is users can still be liquidated on V3, and they should be migrated first to allow this to happen.

It is possible and reccomended that these changes be implemented and deployed before V3 is actually deployed. Once V3 is deployed, these
special permissions can be  granted by simply setting `AddressResolver` entry for `LegacyMarket` to the permissioned address.

### Test Cases

<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for SIPs but can be included with the implementation..-->

To ensure smooth transition, a number of tests are being added to V2x, the `LegacyMarket` itself, and `V3`.

To be further documented here.

### Configurable Values (Via SCCP)

<!--Please list all values configurable via SCCP under this implementation.-->


- `AddressResolver.importAddresses(['LegacyMarket'], ['<insert address>'])`: initially 0 address, later updated to v3 `LegacyMarket` contract address with SCCP approval to kick off migration
- `SynthetixDebtShare.setAuthorizedBroker('<insert address>')`: should also be updated to authorize the `LegacyMarket` to transfer debt shares to itself (no code update required, just documenting later need to set this value).
