## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

The sip proposes to allow the Spartan Council to vote on adding new synths, futures markets and shorts via SCCP. 

## Motivation


<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs? The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

Currently the addition of new synths, futures markets and shorts requires a sip and a presentation. However, there are situations where new listings are straightforward and might not warrant the slow governance processes of a SIP and presentation. Therefore, this sip proposes to allow governance to list new assets into the platform via SCCP, and in such situations the unanimous consent of all members of the SC is needed. 
This sip does not preclude that the spartan council can still vote on new listings with a SIP and in such cases, the normal majority governance rule is applied. 

### The pros:
- Expedited listing of new assets that are not contentious
- Decrease in governance fatigue, due to the need to schedule presentations and annouce it to the community

### The cons:
- Increased chance that certain assets might be listed that would be contentious
- The sip presentations help communicate to the community the underlyings of governance activity, skipping the presentatiosn and going directly to vote would result in less transparency in the decision process

It is important to mention that the criteria the new spot synths / futures markets / shorts that would be listed via SCCP should satisfy any one of the following categories:
- Have high market cap and abundant liquidity
- Are stables or commodities
- Exibit low intra-day volatility
- Are currently listed by synthetix in certain products (i.e., the case of AAVE being available as spot synth but not futures market)
