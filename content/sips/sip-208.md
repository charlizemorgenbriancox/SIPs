## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

Debt migration allows stakers to migrate their SNX collateral and debt position from Ethereum to Optimism without burning sUSD to clear their debt.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the SIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the SIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

This SIP introduces a new function to migrate debt from Ethereum to Optimism. It relies on the fungibility of Synths across both networks to remove the need to burn debt before migrating SNX collateral to optimism. The new function will migrate all vesting entries and staked SNX from Ethereum to Optimism in a single transaction.

## Motivation

<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the SIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the SIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is innaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the SIP will address the issue!-->

Prior to the debt Synthesis it is not possible to migrate a stakers position from Ethereum to Optimism without burning all of their debt first. This makes it difficult for large stakers to source sufficient sUSD liquidity to unwind their entire debt position. This new function will allow for a much faster transition to Optimism staking and will allow all inflation to be transitioned to the new network.

## Specification

<!--The specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature, there are five sections
1. Overview
2. Rationale
3. Technical Specification
4. Test Cases
5. Configurable Values
-->

### Overview

<!--This is a high level overview of *how* the SIP will solve the problem. The overview should clearly describe how the new feature will be implemented.-->

This SIP will allow a staker to migrate their debt position by debiting their debt shares on L1 and minting them on Optimism, it will also transfer all SNX collateral to Optimism in the same transaction.

### Rationale

<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs. The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

Requiring stakers to burn all debt before migrating to Optimism puts uneccesary stress on the network, particularly sUSD liquidity. After the deployment of Debt Shares and the Debt Synthesis it is possible to update the debt shares position for each staker directly, this is a much better process for stakers than forcing them to exit the debt pool, thus clearing their debt register position then requiring them to mint on Optimism to reenter the debt pool after migrating.

### Technical Specification

<!--The technical specification should outline the public API of the changes proposed. That is, changes to any of the interfaces Synthetix currently exposes or the creations of new ones.-->
