## Summary

Second stage of futures markets rollout: add markets for SOL, AVAX, MATIC, AAVE, UNI, EUR, GOLD, SILVER.

## Abstract

The initial futures markets rollout (SIP-80) was done with BTC, ETH, LINK to reduce the complexity and potential for error. To satisfy the minimal useful product offering additional markets should be added.

## Motivation

There are multiple reasons for adding more markets as soon as possible:

- Make the product offering more useful for traders and integrations. E.g. this will already allow constructing simple pair trades (e.g. ETH/SOL, BTC/GOLD), simple basket / index trades.
- Allow experimenting with different market settings (e.g. funding rate, leverage) in order to address issues and find optimal configurations sooner.
- Allow establishing pausing/resuming automation for rolling out more TradFi markets.
- Establish a larger amount of markets so that UIs and tooling will be built with the right assumptions and features.

The additional markets to be added are chosen from:

- Already supported Synths: SOL, AVAX, MATIC, AAVE, UNI, EUR.
- Commodities markets with Chainlink OCR feeds on optimism: GOLD, SILVER.

Release will be done when all required feeds are available and checked for latency issues.

## Specification

If pausing / resuming automation isn't ready in time for mainnet release GOLD and SILVER markets will be deployed but immediately paused until automation is reliable on the testnet deployment.

With these markerFee / takerFee:
- SOL, AVAX, AAVE, UNI: 40 / 50 (to be adjusted in SCCPs down gradually)
- MATIC: 25 / 30
- EUR, GOLD, SILVER: 20 / 25

And the rest of the initial market parameters (same as current LINK market for all new markets):
