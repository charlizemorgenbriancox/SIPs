## Summary

Second stage of futures markets rollout: add markets for SOL, LUNA, AVAX, MATIC, AAVE, UNI, EUR, GOLD, SILVER.

## Abstract

The initial futures markets rollout (SIP-80) was done with BTC, ETH, LINK to reduce the complexity and potential for error. To satisfy the minimal useful product offering additional markets should be added.

## Motivation

There are multiple reasons for adding more markets as soon as possible:

- Make the product offering more useful for traders and integrations. E.g. this will already allow constructing simple pair trades (e.g. ETH/SOL, BTC/GOLD), simple basket / index trades.
- Allow experimenting with different market settings (e.g. funding rate, leverage) in order to address issues and find optimal configurations sooner.
- Allow establishing pausing/resuming automation for rolling out more TradFi markets.
- Establish a larger amount of markets so that UIs and tooling will be built with the right assumptions and features.
- Experiment with launching futures markets without corresponding spot synths.

The additional markets to be added are chosen from:

- Already supported Synths: SOL, AVAX, MATIC, AAVE, UNI, EUR.
- Commodities markets with Chainlink OCR feeds on optimism: GOLD, SILVER.
- New crypto feeds (without spot Synths): LUNA.

Release will be contingent on new feeds being available, and checked for latency issues.

## Specification

If pausing / resuming automation isn't ready in time for mainnet release GOLD and SILVER markets will be deployed but immediately paused until automation is reliable on the testnet deployment.

Initial market parameters TBD.
