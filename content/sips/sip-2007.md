## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

This SIP proposes adding `XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX`, controlled by PDAO, to the direct integration module with the benefit of performing exchanges between `sUSD` and `sETH`  at 0 fees.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the SIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the SIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

As outlined in [SIP-267](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-267/), every new Direct Integration needs to be specified in a sip along with the parameters proposed for that integration. Therefore this sip proposes to allow pdao to perform exchanges between `sUSD` and `sETH` with no fees. 

## Motivation

The primary motivation is to enable PDAO to perform the following set of transactions:
1) ETH > sETH (Wrappers)
2) sETH > sUSD (Exchange)
3) sUSD > DAI (Wrappers)
4) DAI > ETH (AMM's)

These transactions will help manage the following:
- The premium on sUSD vs DAI, performing the above would lower the sUSD peg to around the fee paid on performing an ETH > DAI swap on the best amm available
- Allows unwinding of the DAI wrapper
- Allows strategic control of the composition of synths, as to limit outsized impacts on the skew

Any excess ETH made from performing this operation (given the sUSD premium), would be sent to Treasury.
