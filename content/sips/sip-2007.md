<!--You can leave these HTML comments in your merged SIP and delete the visible duplicate text guides, they will not appear and may be helpful to refer to if you edit it again. This is the suggested template for new SIPs. Note that an SIP number will be assigned by an editor.

## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

This SIP proposes providing the below multisigs, controlled by a subset of the members of PDAO & Core-Contributors, direct integration privileges, allowing them to perform exchanges between `sUSD` and `sETH`  at 0 fees:
- On Optimism `0x3cbaB31E655529Ba3CeFfdf79C97bbF3afEB831D`
- On Ethereum `0x8d8010ea725746b76baffa20968ecb0a5b2cc247`

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the SIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the SIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

As outlined in [SIP-267](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-267/), every new Direct Integration needs to be specified in a sip along with the parameters proposed for that integration. Therefore this sip proposes to allow special addresses ability to perform exchanges between `sUSD` and `sETH` with no fees. 

## Motivation

The primary motivation is to exhert some control over the peg by performing the below in either direction:
1) ETH > sETH (Wrappers)
2) sETH > sUSD (Exchange)
3) sUSD > DAI (Wrappers or AMM's)
4) DAI > ETH (AMM's)

These transactions will help manage the following:
- The premium on sUSD vs DAI, performing the above would lower the sUSD peg to around the fee paid on performing an ETH > DAI swap on the best amm available
- Allows unwinding of the DAI wrapper
- Allows strategic control of the composition of synths, as to limit outsized impacts on the skew

## Restrictions & Limitations:
- All excess ETH made from performing any operations would be sent to Treasury
- All operations done on those multisigs would be performed solely with the intent of aligning the sUSD peg with that of the sETH peg
- The SC would be able to disable these privileges by simply voting on an SCCP that revokes the 0 exchange fee

## Specification

The following parameters would be specified on the multisigs:
- On Optimism `0x3cbaB31E655529Ba3CeFfdf79C97bbF3afEB831D`
- On Ethereum `0x8d8010ea725746b76baffa20968ecb0a5b2cc247`
