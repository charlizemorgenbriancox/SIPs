## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

This SIP proposes to put in place the following action plan that unwinds the negative ETH skew:
- Increase the cap on the L1 LUSD wrappr to sUSD 150 million
- Increase the burn Fee on the L1 LUSD wrappr to 6%
- Request that Treasury Council unwinds a certain amount of negative skew (amounts at their discretion) with the following strategy:
 
  a) Buy a certain amount of LUSD from the market
  
  b) Mint sUSD with that LUSD
  
  c) Swap sUSD to sETH (on Synthetix)
  
  d) burn sETH to release ETH (with the ETH Wrappr)
  
  e) Swap the ETH back to LUSD and repeat step (a)

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the SIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the SIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

The negative [ETH skew](https://ibb.co/q79XwP4) requires that minters take on a short ETH position to hedge their debt. Although, this has significantly contributed towards the decrease in snx stakers debt over the last few months, the correlation with snx price has been unpleasant experience for managing c-ratios. 

## Motivation

<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the SIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the SIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is innaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the SIP will address the issue!-->

Replacing the wrapped ETH with a stablecoin will lead to a much more stable debt pool, requiring less effort on minters for managing their debt.

*Motive Behind Not Using AMMs:*

 Avoiding the use of AMMs to fix the skew, allows us to control the flow of synths much more precisely and avoid a situation where arbitrage bots buy the sETH from an amm and send it back to sUSD undoing the negative skew unwind. The main problem here is that different curve pools have different amplification factors, therefore when we inject sETH to the sETH/ETH pool on CRV (step d), arbitrage bots will swap that sETH back to sUSD to profit.

*Motive Behind Burn Fee Rate:*

The LUSD wrappr burn fee has been increased to 6%, as to allow for LUSD to be procurred when Liquity protocol requires that LUSD to perform liquidations, but also locks-in that LUSD in our protocol as minimize the impact of LUSD supply volatility on the sUSD peg.

*Timing Recomendations:*

The Treasury Council has full discretion on the timing of implementation, but it would be preferable to time it when ETH reaches highs at to lock-in a low debt position on minters and would help procure LUSD cheaply due to abundance of LUSD when ETH reaches highs.

*Anticipated Cost:*

The expected cost of this plan should be less than 1% of the unwound amount, given the associated transaction cost of swapping sUSD to sETH (25 bp) and swapping ETH to LUSD (30-50 bp).

*Key Risk Factor:*

Key risk to consider is that by backing the debt pool with LUSD, the protocol takes on the contract and credit risk associated with the liquity protocol. However, given that the LUSD is locked on L1 (as opposite the optimism) the credit risk is significantly more manageable as it can be unlocked atomically for liquidations.

## Specification

### Overview

<!--This is a high level overview of *how* the SIP will solve the problem. The overview should clearly describe how the new feature will be implemented.-->
N/A

### Rationale

<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs. The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->
N/A

### Technical Specification

<!--The technical specification should outline the public API of the changes proposed. That is, changes to any of the interfaces Synthetix currently exposes or the creations of new ones.-->

N/A

### Test Cases

<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for SIPs but can be included with the implementation..-->

N/A

### Configurable Values (Via SCCP)

<!--Please list all values configurable via SCCP under this implementation.-->
