## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the SCCP.-->

This SIP proposes a new system for facilitating on-chain elections.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the variable change proposed.-->

This system allows users to nominate candidates, cast votes based on participation in multiple Synthetix deployments, and distribute NFTs to the winners across an arbitrary number of EVM-compatible blockchains.

## Motivation

<!--The motivation is critical for SCCPs that want to update variables within Synthetix. It should clearly explain why the existing variable is not incentive aligned. SCCP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->

The proposed system builds on learnings from Synthetix’s existing elections system, implements the latest smart contract architecture developed by Synthetix’s Core Contributors, and integrates with cutting-edge decentralized technology for reading and writing data across multiple chains. This proposal strives for simplicity and extensibility, such that voting power calculations can be easily adapted based on future governance decisions around Synthetix’s collateralization and cross-chain expansion.

This system consists of a single codebase that can be deployed as a _mothership_ or a _satellite_. Votes are cast on the mothership, which transfers NFTs to the winners and sends a cross-chain message to the satellite deployments, triggering the transfer of their NFTs as well.

The mothership could be deployed on OP Mainnet (to maintain parity with the current elections system), Ethereum mainnet (for maximum security), a Synthetix-specific appchain, or any other EVM-compatible blockchain.

The representation of election winners as NFTs allows for direct integrations with deployments of the Synthetix protocol—as the owner of a deployment or as a [configurer](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-341/), which can only execute SCCPs—via a [Safe Module](https://docs.safe.global/safe-smart-account/modules). This module could also require approval from a Risk Council and/or implement a timelock/veto pattern. Other protocols, including existing ecosystem projects, are able to integrate with these NFTs to grant the holders special permissions or incentives as well.

## Specification

<!--The specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature, there are five sections
1. Overview
2. Rationale
3. Technical Specification
4. Test Cases
5. Configurable Values
-->

### Overview

<!--This is a high level overview of *how* the SIP will solve the problem. The overview should clearly describe how the new feature will be implemented.-->

This system is always in one of two states:

- **Administration Period** - At the beginning of this period, anyone can call the `resolve` function on the mothership. NFTs are distributed to the nominees which have received the most votes in the previous cycle. A cross-chain message is sent via **Wormhole Messages** such that the NFTs controlled by the satellite deployments are redistributed as well. Addresses can be nominated for the following election period.

- **Election Period** - At the beginning of this period, anyone can call the `commence` function on the mothership. This function uses **Pyth Entropy** to select a random timestamp from the previous period to use for voting power calculation. Throughout the voting period, users may cast a ballot on the mothership, distributing their voting power across an array of nominees. Voting power is determined with **Wormhole Queries**, which is used to iterate over an array of snapshot contracts on specified chains to read values at the selected timestamp.

### Rationale

<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs. The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

This system allows a single codebase to be maintained for deployment across multiple chains with separate instances for each council, all managed in Synthetix V3’s [deployments repository](https://github.com/synthetixio/synthetix-deployments).

This is system is fully autonomous. There is no need for specific addresses to have elevated permissions, the creation of merkle trees, keepers triggering on-chain snapshots, or otherwise. Election winners will be motivated to call the `resolve` function as soon as possible, such that they receive NFTs. The`commence` function can be triggered automatically when the first vote is cast in the election period, if necessary.

This system could also be owned by a Safe with a custom Safe Module that includes special requirements for modifying election system configurations (i.e. “meta-governance”) like the list of registered snapshot contracts or period durations. A Safe Module which owns another aspect of the Synthetix protocol should enforce similar requirements for the `nominateOwner` functions.

The use of timestamp randomness mitigates the risk of a governance attack in which a user flash loans assets and deposits them on the block where the voting power is calculated.

The use of cross-chain messaging maximizes interoperability and resilience against cross-chain infrastructure failure. For example, an alternative architecture could involve the election winners only being recorded on the mothership, requiring a cross-chain query for any integration on another chain. This would mean integrations on other chains would fail if the cross-chain queries were unsuccessful. Instead, under this model, temporary cross-chain query downtime would only prevent voting during the outage. Also, with the proposed architecture, a failure in cross-chain message delivery could be resolved by simply calling the `resolve` function again.

### Technical Specification

<!--The technical specification should outline the public API of the changes proposed. That is, changes to any of the interfaces Synthetix currently exposes or the creations of new ones.-->

#### Initialization and Configuration

On initialization, the system can distribute the NFTs to a list of provided addresses, which also determines the total number of NFTs for the system. The configuration consists of the duration of the administration period and the election period, a list of chain IDs/addresses for all of the deployments, an array of chain IDs/addresses of the ERC-20 compliant contracts to use for calculating voting power, and whether voting power should be calculated on a linear or quadratic scale.

This proposal entails the mothership being deployed on OP Mainnet and all councils using a quadratic scale, except for the Treasury Council and the Spartan Council.

#### Functionality

All of the following functions are only available on the mothership:

- `configure` - This updates the configuration settings, outlined above.
- `nominate` - During the administration period, any address can nominate themselves to run in the following election period.
- `withdraw` - During the administration period, any nominee can remove themselves as a candidate for the following election period.
- `commence` - After the duration of the administration period has expired, this function can be called by anyone to initialize a new election period. This uses **Pyth’s Entropy** to randomly select a timestamp from the previous administration period that will be used to calculate voting power.
- `cast` - During the election period, a user can call this function with a mapping of candidates to weights (pertaining to the voting power they’d like to assign to those candidates). To calculate their total voting power, a call is made to **Wormhole Queries** (per ERC-7412) to retrieve the user’s share of the total supply of each ERC-20 contract at the timestamp selected by Entropy. For Synthetix V2X, this would reference the [debt shares contract](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-185/). For V3, this would reference a simple [rewards distributor](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-305/) contract designed for this purpose.
- `resolve` - After the duration of the election period has expired, anyone can call this function to initialize the next administration period. The mothership re-assigns the owners of the NFTs to the winners of the election of the system and calls **Wormhole Messaging** to transfer the NFTs on the satellite deployments. (Note that the NFTs cannot be transfered by their owners; only the election system may transfer them.)

### Test Cases

<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for SIPs but can be included with the implementation..-->

Relevant tests will be developed during implementation.

### Configurable Values (Via SCCP)

<!--Please list all values configurable via SCCP under this implementation.-->
