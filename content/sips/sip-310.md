<!--You can leave these HTML comments in your merged SIP and delete the visible duplicate text guides, they will not appear and may be helpful to refer to if you edit it again. This is the suggested template for new SIPs. Note that an SIP number will be assigned by an editor. When opening a pull request to submit your SIP, please use an abbreviated title in the filename, `sip-draft_title_abbrev.md`. The title should be 44 characters or less.-->

## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

This SIP proposes a "feature flag" mechanism to only allow certain addresses access to parts of the protocol.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the SIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the SIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

This functionality allows specific functions to be restricted with a feature flag such that only SCCP-specified addresses are able to call them. The flag may also be removed via SCCP, such that anyone can use the relevant functionality. Initially, feature flags will be implemented for the creation of pools and registration of markets.

## Motivation

<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the SIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the SIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is inaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the SIP will address the issue!-->

To reduce risk to the protocol, it would be advantageous for governance to decide which addresses are able to create pools and register markets. We anticipate governance will choose to remove these feature flags and other feature flags may be added in the future.

## Technical Specification

<!--The specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature, there are five sections
1. Overview
2. Rationale
3. Technical Specification
4. Test Cases
5. Configurable Values
-->

### Overview

<!--This is a high level overview of *how* the SIP will solve the problem. The overview should clearly describe how the new feature will be implemented.-->

Implementation involves the creation of a `FeatureFlagModule` in the core system and usage of this functionality in the `createPool()` and `registerMarket()` functions.

### Rationale

<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs. The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

To implement the ability for governance to control usage of the`createPool()` and `registerMarket()` functions, it is preferable to architect a generic solution, such that it could be reused for future features.

Generally, this approach increases the agility of the protocol when deploying new features. Rather than requiring SIPs, code changes, and deployments, early usage of features in production can be controlled via SCCP.

### Technical Specification

<!--The technical specification should outline the public API of the changes proposed. That is, changes to any of the interfaces Synthetix currently exposes or the creations of new ones.-->

The Feature Flag Module will implement the following interface:

```
interface IFeatureFlagModule {
    function setFeatureFlagAllowAll(bytes32 feature, bool allowAll) external;

    function addToFeatureFlagAllowlist(bytes32 feature, address permissioned) external;

    function removeFromFeatureFlagAllowlist(bytes32 feature, address permissioned) external;

    function getFeatureFlagAllowAll(bytes32 feature) external view returns (bool);

    function getFeatureFlagAllowlist(bytes32 feature) external view returns (address[] memory);

    function isFeatureAllowed(bytes32 feature, address addressToCheck) external view returns (bool);
}
```

A feature flag is by default "live" when a function calls `ensureAccessToFeature`. This means only addresses added to the feature flag are able to use the relevant function. You can turn off the feature flag entirely by setting `allowAll` to `true` which allows any address access to the feature.

A feature flag named `createPool` and `registerMarket` will be applied to the corresponding functions by calling the aforementioned `ensureAccessToFeature` function.

### Test Cases

<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for SIPs but can be included with the implementation..-->

Relevant tests will be developed during implementation.

### Configurable Values (Via SCCP)

<!--Please list all values configurable via SCCP under this implementation.-->

- Enable/disable the `createPool` flag
- List of addresses associated with the `createPool` flag
- Enable/disable the `registerMarket` flag
- List of addresses associated with the `registerMarket` flag
