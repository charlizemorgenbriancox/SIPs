## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

This SIP proposes the addition of a cross-chain transfer function to the snxUSD token.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the SIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the SIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

Leveraging cross-chain messaging, Synthetix is able to implement highly efficient digital asset transfer via _teleportation_. In its simplest form, this entails burning snxUSD on a source chain, sending a cross-chain message containing the amount burned, and minting that quantity of tokens on the destination chain. A teleportation fee can be collected and distributed to backers of snxUSD.

## Motivation

<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the SIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the SIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is inaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the SIP will address the issue!-->

As liquidity in DeFi continues to move across various L2s, it is increasingly important for protocols to create chain-agnostic abstractions. Given that Synthetix is currently deployed on two chains, the ability to transfer assets bi-directionally (without a challenge verification period imposed by roll-ups, e.g.) would already be a very valuable feature for the protocol.

Teleporters were originally proposed in [SIP-204](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-204/), but implementation was postponed due to the lack of decentralized cross-chain messaging solutions available. This proposal entails the use of the [Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP)](https://chain.link/cross-chain). Because Synthetix is already dependent on Chainlink's infrastructure for price feed oracles, this proposal doesn't create any trust assumptions with additional third parties.

Teleporters are an improvement over AMM-based cross-chain bridging solutions because there is no slippage incurred from liquidity available on destination chains. Instead, the protocol can apply a fee structure at the discretion of governance, further incentivizing stakers to back the stablecoin.

## Technical Specification

<!--The specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature, there are five sections
1. Overview
2. Rationale
3. Technical Specification
4. Test Cases
5. Configurable Values
-->

### Overview

<!--This is a high level overview of *how* the SIP will solve the problem. The overview should clearly describe how the new feature will be implemented.-->

Teleporters involve adding `transferCrossChain` and `ccipReceive` functions to the snxUSD token with appropriate validations and fee capture functionality.

### Rationale

<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs. The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

We propose making the transfer function available on the snxUSD proxy, rather than the core system proxy. This is an extension of the ERC-20 interface (which already essentially includes a "same-chain transfer" function).

This proposal entails collecting fees in ETH, rather than snxUSD, for the following reasons:

- Users will always receive the same amount of snxUSD that they have transferred.
- This is the most efficient method to collect fees, as no additional token transfers are involved in the transaction.
- Users are already paying ETH for gas fees to execute the transaction.

Future SIPs could involve additional fee payment methods (such as snxUSD), alternative fee structures, and circuit-breaking functionality for added security.

### Technical Specification

<!--The technical specification should outline the public API of the changes proposed. That is, changes to any of the interfaces Synthetix currently exposes or the creations of new ones.-->

Implementation entails two functions on the snxUSD token module:

#### `transferCrossChain(uint chainId, address recipient, uint amount) payable returns (bool)`

- Confirm that the sender has a sufficient balance of snxUSD to transfer.
- Determine the fee amount in ETH by taking an SCCP-specified percentage of the amount transferred (plus any SCCP-specified flat fee) and denominate that amount in ETH based on a price oracle.
- Transfer the fee into the contract and notify a rewards distributor of the collected fees.
- Encode the `recipient` and `amount` and call `ccipSend`.
- Burn the amount of snxUSD transferred.

#### `ccipReceive(Any2EVMMessage calldata message)`

- Verify that the `srcChainId` and `sender` data in the message correspond to a legitimate deployment of the snxUSD token.
- Mint the amount of snxUSD tokens to the destination address, as specified in the message's `data`.

_Note that this function must conform to the existing CCIP interface._

### Test Cases

<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for SIPs but can be included with the implementation.-->

Relevant tests will be developed during implementation.

### Configurable Values (Via SCCP)

<!--Please list all values configurable via SCCP under this implementation.-->

- Each deployment should specify fee amounts and the address of a rewards distributor (per [SIP-305](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-305/)) to receive these fees.
- Every deployment of Synthetix must be configured with the address of snxUSD on each other chain, such that it can verify the sender of messages that request minting snxUSD.
