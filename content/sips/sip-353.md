## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

This proposal reassigns the responsibility for the protocol roadmap to the Core Contributor Committee (CCC), formalizes the budget cycle from the Treasury Council (TC).

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the SIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the SIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

After the ineffective transfer of roadmap responsibility to the Spartan Council under [SIP-232](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-232/), this proposal reverts the responsibility to the CCC, and formalizes the Treasury Council's commitment to fund the Core Contributors (CCs) each epoch.


## Motivation

<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the SIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the SIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is inaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the SIP will address the issue!-->

The responsibility for the Synthetix protocol roadmap was transferred to the Spartan Council by [SIP-232](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-232/), but no roadmap has materialized. The CCs have been focused on developing V3, but as V3 matures the protocol need a governance structure that is more future proof. The roadmap needs clear accountability, to better align development effort.

The TC's primary role is to fund the project's operations, and since the CCs are the largest and most important cost, it's important to formalize the candence of transferring funding.

## Specification

<!--The specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature, there are five sections
1. Overview
2. Rationale
3. Technical Specification
4. Test Cases
5. Configurable Values
-->

### Overview

<!--This is a high level overview of *how* the SIP will solve the problem. The overview should clearly describe how the new feature will be implemented.-->

The proposed changes include:
1. Reassigning the protocol roadmap responsibility to the CCC.
2. Formalizing the TC's commitment to fund the CCs and the frequency of funds transfer each epoch.

### Rationale

<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs. The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

**Roadmap:** The CCC taking responsbility to create and manage the roadmap fills the existing governance gap, and aligns protocol development with governance decisions. Rather than being responsible for the content, the CCC is responsible for facilitating the creation and maintenance of the roadmap, by engaging with the Spartan Council and relevant community.  

**Funding:** The Treasury Council is well capitalized for short and medium term operations, including CCs. A robust budget process ensures that the protocol's development continues seamlessly, CCs are confident of the protocol's runway, and capital is allocated against milestones. 

### Technical Specification

<!--The technical specification should outline the public API of the changes proposed. That is, changes to any of the interfaces Synthetix currently exposes or the creations of new ones.-->

**Roadmap:** The CCC will update and present a draft list of milestones for the epoch to the Spartan Council for approval in the first month of each governance epoch. The CCC is accountable for the roadmap's delivery and updating the SC and TC at the end of each epoch.

**Budget:** The CCC will maintain the itemized budget, aligned with the roadmap's milestones, to be approved by the TC. The TC will fund the CCC each epoch, ensuring a minimum of 3 months' operational runway at all times.

#### Other CCC Mandates:
*No change*

<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for SIPs but can be included with the implementation..-->
