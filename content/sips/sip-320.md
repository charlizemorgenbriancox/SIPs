## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

This SIP proposes adding functionality that allows markets to control the time before which collateral delegation can be modified.

## Motivation

<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the SIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the SIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is inaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the SIP will address the issue!-->

Markets may implement logic where orders can be anticipated by potential liquidity providers, who may decide to provide liquidity just to capture the fees generated by a particular trade. For example, someone may choose to provide liquidity after noticing an asynchronous order commitment and then remove their liquidity directly after the trade has executed. This may also take the form of "JIT" (just in time) liquidity for synchronous/atomic trades, a well-known MEV strategy which provides essentially risk-free yield at the expense of passive LPs on AMMs like Uniswap.

By allowing market implementations to specify the time since delegation which must elapse before collateral delegation may be withdrawn, passive LPs can be protected (insofar as the LPs entering to capture fees from a particular trade will be forced to take on exposure to fluctuations in debt generated by the market afterwards as well).

## Rationale

<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs. The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

This functionality is intended to achieve a similar effect as the "burn lock" on the Synthetix V2 protocol. It is also similar to the [market-locked collateral](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-309/) functionality already implemented in Synthetix V3.

## Technical Specification

<!--The technical specification should outline the public API of the changes proposed. That is, changes to any of the interfaces Synthetix currently exposes or the creations of new ones.-->

- Add a `lastConfigurationTime` timestamp associated with the pool and a `lastDelegationTime` mapping of an account ID to a timestamp.
- Add `setMarketMinDelegateTime(uint128 marketId, uint minDelegateTime)` to the `IMarketManager` interface that allows a market to associate a `minDelegateTime` with the market. Revert if this value is greater than `setMarketMinDelegateTime_max`.
- When `setPoolConfiguration` is called, it takes the maximum of all the `minDelegateTime` value for all of the markets its backing and it reverts if `block.timestamp` minus this value is greater than the `lastConfigurationTime`.
- When `delegateCollateral` is called, it takes the maximum of all the `minDelegateTime` value for all of the markets its pool is backing and it reverts if `block.timestamp` minus this value is greater than the `lastDelegationTime`.
- After the `setPoolConfiguration` and `delegateCollateral` function is called (in all cases), `lastConfigurationTime` and `lastDelegationTime` are updated to be `block.timestamp`, respectively.

### Test Cases

<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for SIPs but can be included with the implementation..-->

Relevant tests will be developed during implementation.

### Configurable Values (Via SCCP)

<!--Please list all values configurable via SCCP under this implementation.-->

- `setMarketMinDelegateTime_max` (uint32) - Markets cannot set a `minDelegateTime` to a value greater than this. This can be updated with the `setConfig` function.
