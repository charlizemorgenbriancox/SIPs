## Simple Summary

Add Synth EUR on Optimism, with a 15 bp synthExchangeFee

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the SIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the SIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

Add Synth EUR on Optimism

## Motivation

<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the SIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the SIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is innaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the SIP will address the issue!-->

EUR is avaliable to trade on Futures with [SIP-217](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-217/) and `sEUR` has been on mainnet since the Havven day. This SIP is intend to bring feature parity between layers in line and get in on EUR adoption on DeFi. `agEUR` has deployed on Optimism and could benefit from `agEUR => sEUR => sUSD/sETH => ETH` meta-liquidity.
