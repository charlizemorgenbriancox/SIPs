## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

Enable the transfer of sUSD for deposit and withdrawal through Optimism Bridge

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the SIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the SIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "We propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

Now that SIP-165 has been completed, sUSD is fungible on L1 and L2. Due to no bridges being set up, however, it is still not possible to send
sUSD between layers.

Therefore, in a way similar to how we currently deposit or withdraw SNX from L2, synths will be transferrable using the optimism bridge. A user will be able to call
a public function on `SynthetixBridgeToOptimism` or `SynthetixBridgeToBase` to initiate a transfer to the other layer by burning synths, and after the grace period elapses, the funds will be minted
on the other side.

## Motivation

<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs? The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

The spartan council has decided not to support SIP-204 for bridging synths between networks. Therefore, to recoup some of the benefit of SIP-165,
we must support some method for synth transfer between layers.

This will also lead to easier migration of debt from L1 to L2, forced or not.

### Technical Specification

#### Bridge

New methods `depositSynth(bytes32 name, address destination, uint amount)` and `withdrawSynth(bytes32 name, address destination, uint amount)` will be added to `BaseSynthetixBridge`. Upon call to `depositSynth`, synth will be burnt from the user, and
a cross-chain message sent to the destination chain counterpart to call `withdrawSynth`. When `withdrawSynth` is called, the usual checks are done to verify the
message origin, and then the appropriate synths are minted for the user.

The actual mint and burn will be done through `Issuer` to reduce
the upgrade complexity.

#### Optimism

The `optimism.github.io` repository will need to be updated to include the `sUSD` synth information and contract address so that its information appears on Optimism Gateway.

#### Chainlink

Chainlink will need to track a new source for the issued synths and debt ratio oracle, the synths in transit.

In an atomic call, the oracle should retrieve the values for `currentDebt` and the last `n` events for `SynthSent`, and the last `n` events for `SynthReceived`, where `n` is the largest expected number of synth transfers in flight.

After retrieving data from all networks, the synths in transit can be calculated:

```
let synthsNotReceivedEvents = synthSentEvents.filter(e => synthReceivedEvents.find(e.id))
let synthsInTransit = sum(synthsNotReceivedEvents, 'amount');
```

`synthsInTransit` should be added to the final total for issued synths.

Chainlink will be responsible for implementing the code for this additional requirement.
