## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

Deprecate `sDEFI` and open it for redemption at the price of 3,195$ per token.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the SIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the SIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

Deprecate `sDEFI` and allow for synth holder to redeem it into `sUSD` by `SynthRedeemer` described in SIP-174.

## Motivation

<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the SIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the SIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is innaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the SIP will address the issue!-->

`sDEFI` has `LUNA` with 10% weighting in it which has gone to 0 from `UST` bank run, triggering the circuit breaker. The reason why the redemption was chosen are:
 - Enso user has signalled to redeem it as `sUSD`.
 - `sDEFI` does not exist on Optimism.
 - Low interest and rebalancing overhead from governance.
 - Questionable underlying that no longer reflect DeFi as whole.
