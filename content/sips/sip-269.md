## Simple Summary

Create OP-PERP market on Optimism.

## Abstract

This is a proposal to offer OP-PERP futures which track the price of $OP token.

## Motivation

$OP is a popular asset among the Synthetix and Kwenta trading communities due to the fact that these projects run on the Optimism network. There may also be demand for an $OP perps product for hedging.

### Rationale

Although the $OP token is relatively new and somewhat volatile, there is already acceptable liquidity and a Chainlink price feed for the token. Given the number of large holders including protocols which have been awarded $OP grants, $OP perps may have a unique use case, and could attract more short open interest than other cryptocurrency pairs.
