## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

Recovers unallocated liquidation rewards due to an initialization issue.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the SIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the SIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "We propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

Shortly after the deployment of SIP-148, accounts were not properly initialized with their entries in the `LiquidatorRewards` contract. This led to an accounting issue where accounts seemed to receive less rewards than intended. 
This SIP ensures that the funds that are locked in the contract are properly recovered and allocated to the relevant accounts.

## Motivation

<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs? The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

To make sure that every account gets their deserved share of the liquidation rewards post-deployment.

### Technical Specification

#### `Synthetix.initializeLiquidatorRewardsRestitution`

We will create a one-time use function that is only callable by the pDAO. 
This function will be used to recover the unallocated rewards from the `LiquidatorRewards` contracts on both layers.

```
bool public restituted = false;

// @param amount The amount of SNX to be recovered and distributed to the rightful owners
function initializeLiquidatorRewardsRestitution(uint amount) external onlyOwner {
    if (!restituted) {
        restituted = true;
        bool success = _transferByProxy(address(liquidatorRewards()), owner, amount);
        require(success, "restitution transfer failed");
    }
}
```

This function will be subsequently removed from `Synthetix` in a patch release.
