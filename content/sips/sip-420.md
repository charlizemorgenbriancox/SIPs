## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed change intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

This SIP proposes a mechanism for SNX stakers to provide staked SNX to protocol-owned staking pool, where the protocol will own the debt and use it to generate yield (e.g. via Ethena). This reduces the complexity of staking for individual stakers while making the overall system more capital efficient.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the SIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done.-->

This SIP proposes the creation of a protocol-owned debt pool, effectively enabling “delegated staking.” SNX holders can contribute their existing debt positions to this pool, which can support a lower issuance ratio (e.g., 200%) because there is no concern about bad debtors within the pool. Over twelve months, debt positions (but not the collateral) will be transferred to this new staking pool. The protocol will use its newly minted sUSD to generate returns for the DAO and it's stakers (e.g. by minting sUSDe via the Ethena protocol). Meanwhile, a higher c-ratio (1000%) will be enforced for solo stakers, incentivizing them to join the delegated system. The collateral from the treasury staking position will be redistributed to all participating stakers over a multi-year period, and an sUSD/USDe liquidity pool will be incentivized for the liquidity of the stablecoin.

## Motivation

<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the SIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.-->

No inflation and mediocre fees have created minimal incentive for SNX staking, even with the lower risk in the current system. Staking rates are at multi-year lows, and a large minority of SNX is unstaked and sitting idle on exchanges. This proposal removes the need for active individual staking and creates a capital-efficient structure that significantly enhances incentives. It also helps rectify past debt inflation issues by ensuring only willing participants remain in the protocol’s debt pool.

## Specification

<!--There are five sections in the Specification:
1. Overview
2. Rationale
3. Technical Specification
4. Test Cases
5. Configurable Values (Via SCCP)
-->

### Overview

<!--This is a high level overview of how the SIP will solve the problem.-->

1. **Create a delegated staking contract**  
   - Stakers deposit their existing debt positions into the new pool.
2. **Raise the current c-ratio to 1000% for all solo stakers**  
   - Discourage solo staking and encourage delegation to the pool.
3. **Set the issuance ratio for the delegated pool to 200%**  
   - Allow more efficient capital deployment without the risk of bad debtors.
4. **Transfer each debt position (but not collateral) over 12 months**  
   - Gradual transition ensures minimal disruption to existing stakers.
5. **Use the sUSD from the delegated pool to generate returns**  
   - For example by leveraging Ethena to generate yield.
   - Penalties, in the form of jubilee reductions, to apply to debt leaving before the 12 months period ends.
6. **Transfer a portion of the treasury staking collateral to other stakers over 2-3 years**  
   - Redistribute collateral systematically and fairly among participants. Approximately 10m SNX should be allocated for this incentive.
7. **Incentivize a liquidity pool for sUSD/USDe**  
   - Encourage stable trading between these two synthetic assets.

### Rationale

<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem.-->

The rationale behind this delegated staking model is twofold:  
1. **Capital Efficiency & Reduced Risk**  
   - By consolidating debt into a single protocol-owned pool, we remove the variability of individual staker defaults or liquidation risks, allowing for a lower issuance ratio.  
2. **Enhanced Staking Incentives**  
   - Transitioning to a delegated model removes the problem of low staking rates. The newly minted sUSDe and the liquidity incentives and debt jubilee make staking more lucrative, driving higher participation. This also addresses historical debt inflation.

### Technical Specification

<!--The technical specification should outline the public API of the changes proposed.-->

A detailed technical design and contract specification will follow upon community feedback. It will likely involve:  
- A new delegated staking smart contract (or extension of existing staking contracts).  
- Logic for transferring debt positions over time without transferring underlying collateral.    
- Mechanisms for distributing SNX collateral from the treasury.

### Test Cases

<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for SIPs but can be included with the implementation.-->

Planned tests will include:  
- Simulation of debt transfer over the 12-month window to ensure no partial debt positions remain stuck.  
- Edge cases where stakers attempt to unstake or alter their collateral mid-transfer.  

### Configurable Values (Via SCCP)

<!--Please list all values configurable via SCCP under this implementation.-->

- Issuance ratio for delegated staking (initially proposed at 200%).  
- C-ratio for non-delegated stakers (initially 1000%).  
- Time windows for transferring debt vs. collateral (initially proposed at 12 months with a linear debt reduction).
- Early exit penalty for leaving the pool within 12 months (initially proposed to linearly reduce from 100% at the time of entering the pool to 50% at the end of the 12 months).
- Incentive amounts for the sUSD/USDe pool.  
- Amount of treasury collateral to be used as staking incentives (initially proposed at 10m SNX).
