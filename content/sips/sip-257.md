## Summary

Create a futures market for Synthetix debt share price (debt ratio) for capital efficient debt-hedging.

## Abstract

Debt-ratio tracks the degree to which the stakers' debt increases or decreases. 

A Chainlink oracle for the debt ratio is already part of the debt system. A futures market will create a more efficient market for debt hedging
and will keep more of the hedging fees in the protocol.

## Motivation

Pros:
- Allows some stakers to hedge debt easily and capital efficiently for a premium (funding rate payments). Advantages over 
[dSNX](https://docs.dhedge.org/dhedge-original-pools/v2-snx-debt-mirror) are: 
  - Full hegding (e.g. inflation due to front-running losses is hedged, futures markets debt is hedged).
  - Capital efficiency (due to available leverage).
  - Simplicity (on same platform - L2 Optimism Kwenta).
- Allows other, more sophisticated traders, to profitably hedge the first group externally (dhedge or directly). This group would arb the funding rate (short the debt on perp, and long hedge externally). These traders would be able to earn funding from the first group (for the actual hedging).
- Creates an additional useful market for protocol users.
- Divert fees from external hedging internally (back to stakers).
- Creates a better hedged debt pool (because more people hedge) - traders willing to pay for hedging have a simple option, traders able
to hedge externally in bulk - can profit from hedging other trader's debt via the funding arb.

Risks and mitigations:
- Feedback loop: if the skew is very large, when debt goes up, stakers hedged via perps are in profit, which increases the debt. To counteract this, the funding rate parameters and OI caps need to be set in a way that ensures that the compensation for the skew in the form of funding is greater than the (which will also ensure that it's profitable to arb, thus reducing the skew). Also, funding payments reduce overall debt, so market's contribution to debt depends on its usage (even if skew is positive).
- Front running risk (naive): debt-ratio rate moves with smaller changes (compared to crypto asset prices) because is essentially a composite index (that's also heavily weighted with a stable-coin) so will be easy to protect from front-running with moderate fees.
- Front running risk (via other assets): a front-runner that can reliably front-run via another Synthetix trade (e.g. another futures market, or spot exchange) will also increase debt-ratio as a side-effect (due to extracting value from the protocol), so in theory is also able to make a profit from the debt-ratio market change. However, the primary front-running will have higher ROI (than the secondary), so it will make sense to utilize all the capital in the more profitable one (the primary) rather than in the secondary (the attenuated debt-ratio).

Parameters:
- Defensive initial parameters: 1M OI caps, 5M SkewScale, 30bps fees for taker/maker, 15bp fees for next-price taker/maker.   

Risk management plan:
- Adjust parameters to prevent risks above by actively monitoring (as the rest of markets) market KPIs. 
- Retire market if not viable.

## Specification

The current debt-oracle has 27 decimal values. The current ExchangeRates contract only accepts up to 18 decimals. Several options exist:
- Update the CL oracle to 18 decimals as the rest of the feeds. There is plenty of precision in 18 decimals for debt accounting.
- Deploy an oracle adapter that will read from existing CL oracle, and adjust the precision and decimal value to 18.  
- Modify ExchangeRates contract to safely accept larger decimal values.
