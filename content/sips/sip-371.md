## Simple Summary
This SIP proposes to add Ethena's staked USDe (sUSDe) as LP collateral to Synthetix V3 on Arbitrum. 

## Abstract
Add sUSDe as a supported collateral type for Arbitrum V3 deployment with minting at 125% C-ratio and a maximum LP cap of $50M. 

## Motivation
Ethena imports basis yield from centralized exchanges by holding ETH and LST's with offsetting short positions in ETH perpetual futures market, with the bulk of the yield distributed to sUSDe holders (currently earning ~30%+ APR so far this year). Yield bearing collateral can drastically improve the capital efficiency of providing liquidity to markets on Synthetix V3 and sUSDe presents an attractive option to fulfill this need. A discussion on the various risk factors and considerations associated with Ethena and USDe can be found [here](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/morpho-spark-dai-vault-update-1-april-2024/24006#performance-and-pool-selection-1). 

## Technical Specification
Implementation of this SIP will be contingent on:
1) Progression of the ongoing rollout of Synthetix V3 on Arbitrum 
2) Support for USDe and sUSDe on the Arbitrum network
3) Availability of an sUSDe price oracle on Arbitrum

## Configurable Values (Via SCCP)
- Maximum LP amount: $50M
- Issuance Ratio: 125%
- Liquidation Ratio: 105%
