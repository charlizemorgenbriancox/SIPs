## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

This SIP proposes a modification to the existing liquidation mechanism defined in [SIP-15](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-15/), the purpose is to reduce the likelihood of cascading liquidations leading to a destabilization of the protocol.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the SIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the SIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

1. Allow the protocol to mint sUSD to liquidate delinquent accounts internally to the protocol.
3. Add a function to liquidate accounts that fall and remain below a specified c-ratio (200%) for more than n hours configurable via SCCP (12h initially)
4. Add a function to self liquidate at any time below the target c-ratio
5. Both liquidation functions will have a liquidation penalty applied, configurable via SCCP (20% and 30% initially)
6. A liquidation pool will be created where liquidated SNX will be sent and distributed based on the instantaneous debt distribution at the time of the liquidation, using the debt shares contract [SIP-185](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-185/) to track the distribution of the SNX.
7. SNX claimed from the liquidation pool will be added to the escrow balance of the claimer and locked for 12 months.

## Motivation

<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the SIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the SIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is inaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the SIP will address the issue!-->

As we have seen with the liquidations on 10-11th of June 2021, there is a possibility for cascading liquidations to have substantial market impact, this happens when new accounts get flagged for liquidation resulting in fear amongst the token holders who take action by selling, this depression in price then causes more accounts to be flagged for liquidation and the cycle continues. This could result in a catastrophic failure of the system leading to large losses by synth holders.

Moreover, users are not effectively incentivized to restore their c-ratio in some cases, as they essentially hold a free put option, which could be very valuable in times of market stress.

Accounts with very large stakes may also believe that they are unable to sell their SNX without incurring more than 10% slippage, which may make walking away and eating the liquidation preferable. Fear from this liquidation of large accounts could also lead to substantial adverse market impact in the anticipation of the liquidation event.

The goal of this SIP is:

1. To more heavily incentivize stakers to act in the best interests of the system during times of stress.
2. To lower uncertainty about bad debt for synth holders and make it clear that SNX holders are the ultimate backstop for the system.
3. To remove forced liquidations at inopportune times and encourage insolvent stakers to explore other options such as self-liquidating in order to avoid costly penalties.

This redesigned liquidation mechanism creates much better incentive alignment within the system by providing options for stakers to repair their c-ratio with a minimal penalty if they are unable or unwilling to buy Synths on market to restore their ratio. It also ensures that in extreme scenarios liquidations happen in a orderly manner without creating a negative feedback loop on the price of SNX. It relaxes the current liquidation mechanism and relies more on self-liquidation for protecting system solvency. Fundamentally it a two layers of penalties that transfers ownership of the protocol from inefficient stakers to more efficient stakers, this combined with the existing incentives to repair collateral ratios should result in a more responsive and stable network collaterisation ratio.

## Specification

<!--The specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature, there are five sections
1. Overview
2. Rationale
3. Technical Specification
4. Test Cases
5. Configurable Values
-->

### Overview

<!--This is a high level overview of *how* the SIP will solve the problem. The overview should clearly describe how the new feature will be implemented.-->

A new contract will be deployed that will receive SNX liquidated using the new liquidation functions. This SNX will be assigned to stakers based on their instantaneous debt percentage at the time of the liquidation using the debt shares contract. The protocol will mint new sUSD to liquidate positions and pay-off the debt of the delinquent account with a fixed liquidation reward denominated in SNX, paid to keepers who perform functions within the liquidation suite.

### Rationale

<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs. The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

The initial version of this SIP proposed a three tiered system of liquidations with instant liquidation as the final backstop of the system, after several SIP presentations and discussions within the community the consensus view is that instant liquidations still pose too large a risk to the network where adversarial actors could try to attack the system to trigger instant liquidations and share in the liquidation rewards. Instant liquidations were therefore removed from the final version of the SIP, but the liquidation penalities for both forced and self liquidations were increased significant to ensure that solvent stakers are sufficiently rewards if a significant percentage of the network elects to utilise self-liquidation.

### Technical Specification

<!--The technical specification should outline the public API of the changes proposed. That is, changes to any of the interfaces Synthetix currently exposes or the creations of new ones.-->

The upgraded Liquidation contract would replace the existing `Liquidations` contract to implement the new functions that allow SNX to be liquidated with sUSD minted against the debt pool.

In order to fairly distirbute the SNX liquidated, the liquidated SNX will be distributed to a new rewards contract that tracks the debt percentage of each staker. This will use a new debt shares mechanism to track the % of debt each staker represents at the time the SNX is liquidated. The debt shares mechanism is explained in detail in [SIP-185](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-185/).

Each minting, burning and claim action will update the debt shares of each staker and allow stakers to claim the SNX liquidated based on their effective % of the debt pool. The staking rewards contract will be updated to support tracking the debt shares of each staker, allowing them to claim the liquidated SNX at any time.

#### Repaying the 
1. The `issuer` contract will calculate the amount of SNX that is liquidated + penalty based on the liquidation type and the sUSD debt to burn from the liquidated staker.
2. The amount of SNX liquidated from the staker is used to repay their debt balance in sUSD.
3. The debt shares of the liquidated staker is updated (during the debt burn action) within the liquidation transaction before the liquidated SNX is rewarded to the liquidated SNX contract.
4. Liquidated staker will recieve less of the liquidated SNX as their debt % is lower after the burning of the debt.
5. The effective debt % of other stakers would increase after the liquidated staker's debt is burned.
6. The SNX claimed will be escrowed for 12 months on the escrow contract.

#### Liquidation Reward Contract

- An updated version of the current Staking Rewards contract that will remove the time based component of the staking rewards.

- When staker's mint and burn sUSD, the amount of debt shares they have will be updated in the liquidation rewards contract.

- The debt shares mechanism will be used in the liquidation reward contract to distribute the liquidated SNX.

- Claiming liquidated SNX will create a vesting entry for 12 months on the escrow contract.
