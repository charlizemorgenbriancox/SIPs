### Simple Summary

Add AVAX, MATIC and EUR Synths on Optimism for trading and shorting.

### Overview

This SIP will add individual Synths for AVAX, MATIC, and EUR tokens on Optimism.

This SIP will also make AVAX, MATIC, and EUR shortable on Optimism.

### Motivation

Listing these additional synths on OE will benefit traders on Synthetix and within the ecosystem as a whole. By listing synths that weâ€™ve never had before, we have the opportunity to attract new traders and to increase the trading volume of the overall Synthetix ecosystem.

### Rationale

Synths tracking AVAX, MATIC, and EUR were chosen after consultation with Synthetix ecosystem partners and the community.
