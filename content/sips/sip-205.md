### Simple Summary

Add AVAX, AAVE, UNI, MATIC, and EUR Synths on Optimism.

### Overview

This SIP will add individual Synths for AVAX, AAVE, UNI, MATIC, and EUR tokens on Optimism.

This SIP will also make AVAX, AAVE, UNI, MATIC, and EUR shortable on Optimism.

### Motivation

Listing these additional synths on OE will benefit traders on Synthetix and within the ecosystem as a whole. By listing synths that weâ€™ve never had before, we have the opportunity to attract new traders and to increase the trading volume of the overall Synthetix ecosystem.

### Rationale

Synths tracking AVAX, AAVE, UNI, MATIC, and EUR  were chosen after consultation with Synthetix ecosystem partners and the community.
