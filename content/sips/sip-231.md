## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

Formalize the functionality of the centralized circuit breaker specified in [SIP-55](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-55/), allowing spot and futures markets to be paused for a particular asset class when a `deltaThreshold`, is exceeded. Trading is resumed when the `observedDelta` goes back below the respective threshold.  
It is important to mention that this SIP only formalizes the implementation of the centralized circuit breaker in a transparent fashion, the circuit breaker is already in place on the ethereum network and is already being used on optimism for pausing commodity and stables assets during times of inactivity. 

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the SIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the SIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "We propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

The centralized circuit breaker would pause, and resume trading based on the configurable SCCP parameters for each asset class. A `deltaThreshold` equivalent to 2x the fees paid on a certain asset would offset the profit from the latency gap.


## Motivation

<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs? The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

The main motivation of this sip is to extend the functionality of [SIP-55](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-55/), to offset the oracle latencies.
Currently dynamic fees can be calibrated further as to offset completely that price gap, however, this approach suffers from a determented UX with prolonged periods of high fees. The centralized circuit breaker would help provide a medium-term solution that allows us to provide traders with reasonable fees and minimal downtime, until the decentralized best execution pricing [sip](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-303/) is launched.

The proposed implementation would also be used as to gauge whether a price feed is active for the case of commodities (XAU/XAG/Oil) as there is no oracle available that provides this gauge on chain and it is not expected to be made available in the near and medium-term.

### Historical Downtime

Below are historical average downtimes expected per week with the parameters specified at 2x fees:

### Configurable Values (Via SCCP)

* `deltaThreshold`: The absolute value of the delta seen between off-chain and on-chain prices that triggers pausing of trading.
