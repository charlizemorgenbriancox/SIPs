<!--You can leave these HTML comments in your merged SIP and delete the visible duplicate text guides, they will not appear and may be helpful to refer to if you edit it again. This is the suggested template for new SIPs. Note that an SIP number will be assigned by an editor.

## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

This SIP proposes adding various view functions to the [spot market implementation ](../sip-317) and a minor alteration to eventing functionality in the oracle manager.

## Motivation

<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the SIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the SIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is inaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the SIP will address the issue!-->

To improve developer experience for integrating with the spot market, it would beneficial to allow smart contracts to return additional data from storage such that event indexing tools like subgraphs arenâ€™t necessary. Also, the additional event in the oracle manager creates more idempotent behavior, such that developer tooling is able to more reliably retrieve the ID for a relevant node.

## Technical Specification

<!--The technical specification should outline the public API of the changes proposed. That is, changes to any of the interfaces Synthetix currently exposes or the creations of new ones.-->

- Add `function getMarketFees(uint128 synthMarketId) external returns (uint256 atomicFixedFee, uint256 asyncFixedFee, int256 wrapFee, int256 unwrapFee)`
- Add `function getMarketSkewScale(uint128 synthMarketId) external returns (uint256 skewScale);`
- Add `function getMarketUtilizationFees(uint128 synthMarketId) external returns (uint256 utilizationFeeRate);`
- Add `function getCollateralLeverage(uint128 synthMarketId) external returns (uint256 collateralLeverage);`
- Add `function getCustomTransactorFees(uint128 synthMarketId, address transactor) external returns (uint256 fixedFeeAmount);`
- Add `function getFeeCollector(uint128 synthMarketId) external returns (address feeCollector);`
- Add `function getReferrerShare(uint128 marketId, address referrer) external returns (uint256 sharePercentage);`
- Emit `NodeRegistered` in the `_registerNode` function, even if the node has already been registered.

### Test Cases

<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for SIPs but can be included with the implementation..-->

Relevant tests will be developed during implementation.

### Configurable Values (Via SCCP)

<!--Please list all values configurable via SCCP under this implementation.-->
