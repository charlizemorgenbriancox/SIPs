## Simple Summary

Improve capital efficiency of providing liquidity to Synthetix V3, by enabling native leverage within Vaults.

## Abstract

Liquidity Providers are able to deposit a range of collateral types across Synthetix deployments, but are limited in the capital efficiency they can achieve. This proposal would enable a native levarage value, so that LPs could choose their desired level of rewards and risk.


## Motivation

Synthetix is powerful in that it is able to accept a wide range of assets as collateral. The only current avenue for LPs to increase their leverage and capital efficiency, is to deposit and mint a stablecoin on Arbitrum (and soon Ethereum). The lack of native leverage limits the yield on desposited collateral, and the current withdraw timeouts make for convoluted looping.

## Specification

TBC


### Rationale
Offering increased capital efficiency will attract more liquidity.


### Technical Specification

TBC

### Test Cases

Test cases will be added to the code base before release.

### Configurable Values

- Maximum leverage per collateral type
