## Simple Summary

Create Synthetix Perps markets for steth/usd and wsteth/usd on Synthetix Perps

## Abstract

This is a proposal to offer steth/usd and wsteth/usd futures which track the price of their respective cryptocurrencies.

## Motivation

Steth and Wsteth currently lack CEX/DEX perp support in DeFi. Launching these markets on Synthetix Perps will expand Synthetix's user base, granting access to widely used markets currently unavailable for leverage trading. Steth and wsteth perps enable speculation, arbitrage, and leverage trading for widely used LSDs.

The proposed markets have also been directly requested by Lido Finance contributors.

See Rational section for additional info

## Rationale

These assets are widely used in DeFi, offering two primary use cases for traders:

Example: Long 100 stETH, short 100 stETH-PERP, and short additional stETH-PERP as rewards accumulate.

Example: Long wstETH-PERP, short ETH-PERP; integrators can create a vault to rebalance margin between both positions.

These are just two use cases for these markets, with traders utilizing them for various purposes such as pure speculation.

## Specification

Data was obtained on May 9th via Coingecko from the following exchanges: Curve, Balancer, Beethoven, and Uniswap

| Coin Name 	|  24 Hour Volume  |
|-----------	|----------------	|
| steth       	| $20,351,675.00 	|
| wsteth       	| $17,810,601.32 	|


This 24-hour volume shows that there is ample volume traded, which points to an appetite for traders. Subsequent data will be shown in SCCPs as reasoning for particular configurable values.

When setting subsequent parameters, it's important to note that steth and wsteth do not have any CEX/DEX perpetual futures markets. This may not be much of a helpful consideration for steth, as it tracks the eth price; however, it may be important for wsteth, which accrues staking rewards in its value.

Upon approval, markets will be paused, and SCCPs must be created to unpause the market and set configurable variables after feeds have been properly tested.

## Technical Specification

Implementation requires implementing off-chain oracle price feeds from Pyth Network and backup on-chain oracles from Chainlink.

Configurable values (read below) will be set in a subsequent SCCP for each market or bundled into one SCCP unpausing all markets.

## Test Cases

n/a

## Configurable Values (Via SCCP)

All Perps V2 configurable values will be set in subsequent SCCPS for each market.
