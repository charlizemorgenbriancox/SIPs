## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

This SIP proposes adding 1inch exchange contracts to the Direct Integration Manager.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the SIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the SIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

As outlined in [SIP-267](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-267/), every new Direct Integration needs to be specified in a sip along with the parameters proposed for that integration. Therefore this sip proposes to allow the 1inch contracts to trade at the overridden parameters mentioned below, where the CRV <> SNX Atomics <> CRV path is guaranteed by 1inch's path finding algorithms. 


## Specification

The following parameters would be specified on the 1inch exchange contracts `0xf021f084477242fe6835c67234b4345de4db19e1` and `0xef6fa3307af6ab6ddcc4826c4945041dd5c18d4b`:

```
{'currencyKey': 'sUSD',
 'dexPriceAggregator': '0x9645C7de2DBe8AAda01868cAa393cB7e5253268c' (uses 30 bp uni pool),
 'atomicMaxVolumePerBlock': 3m$,
 'atomicExchangeFeeRate': 0}

{'currencyKey': 'sETH',
 'dexPriceAggregator': '0x9645C7de2DBe8AAda01868cAa393cB7e5253268c' (uses 30 bp uni pool),
 'atomicMaxVolumePerBlock': 3m$,
 'atomicVolatilityUpdateThreshold': 10,
 'atomicExchangeFeeRate': 35 bp}

{'currencyKey': 'sBTC',
 'dexPriceAggregator': '0x9645C7de2DBe8AAda01868cAa393cB7e5253268c' (uses 30 bp uni pool),
