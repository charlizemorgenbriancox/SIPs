## Simple Summary

List [STRK](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/starknet) on Synthetix Perpetual Futures.

## Abstract

This proposal aims to list STRK perpetual futures on Synthetix Perps, allowing traders to gain exposure or hedge against STRK in the Synthetix ecosystem.

## Motivation

Starknet is at the center of the zk rollup narrative that utilizes STARKs to ensure computational integrity aiding in overcoming Ethereum's scaling limitations. They are going to airdrop their tokens soon (Feb 20, 2024) which means a lot of traders would be interested to hedge against the STRK allocated to them.

Currently STRK is listed as a pre-launch asset on just AEVO with a max leverage of just 2x, Synthetix can take charge of this situation by offering a better hedge with lower margins and carve out this market for itself.

## Specification

See Coingecko for info.

### Technical Specification

Requires Pyth and Chainlink oracles.

### Test Cases

N/A

### Configurable Values (Via SCCP)

The specific configurable values related to the STRK listing, such as leverage limits, funding rates, and margin requirements, will be updated and maintained as per SCCP guidelines.
