## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

In the interests of greater efficiency, this SIP seeks reduce the length of time required to hold a council election by adjusting the timing of both the nominations and voting periods.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the SIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the SIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

The recent passing of [SIP-278: Enable nominations during voting period](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-278/) has reduced the necessary length of an epochal election by allowing nominations to be made concurrently with voting. As the two can now be overlapped, the independent and week-long length of the nominations phase adds to the time it takes to stage an election with little in the way of return. With the V3GM capable of altering these variables and overlapping the two periods, this SIP can remedy the disproportionate time cost of the election process and render it more efficient.

## Motivation

<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the SIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the SIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is inaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the SIP will address the issue!-->

At present, the council election process takes in excess of three weeks to carry out when including preparatory work. At almost one quarter of the entire epoch length, this creates a excessively large drain on the attention of incumbent councillors, Core Contributors and the Synthetix community at large. Reduction in the length of the nomination and voting periods, as well as conducting them simultaneously, will allow an election to be comfortably carried out within a period of two weeks, granting all parties the ability to more effectively concentrate their efforts on either campaigning for council seats when an election is being held or developing the protocol when one is not.

## Specification

<!--The specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature, there are five sections
1. Overview
2. Rationale
3. Technical Specification
4. Test Cases
5. Configurable Values
-->

The change would be achieved by:

- Calling `modifyEpochSchedule` on the four councils.

```solidity
    function modifyEpochSchedule(
        uint64 newNominationPeriodStartDate,
        uint64 newVotingPeriodStartDate,
        uint64 newEpochEndDate
    ) external override onlyOwner onlyInPeriod(ElectionPeriod.Administration) {
```

- The current values would then be altered to the new, desired values.

```solidity
    "nominationPeriodStartDate": "1670754297", // Sun Dec 11 2022 10:24:57 GMT+0000
    "votingPeriodStartDate": "1671359097", // Sun Dec 18 2022 10:24:57 GMT+0000
    "epochEndDate": "1672568697", // Sun Jan 01 2023 10:24:57 GMT+0000
```

```solidity
    "votingPeriodStartDate": "1671667200", // Thu Dec 22 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000
    "epochEndDate": "1672531199", // Sat Dec 31 2022 23:59:59 GMT+0000
    "nominationPeriodStartDate": "1671321600", // Sun Dec 18 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000
```
    
- These changes would set the `nominationPeriodStartDate` to 14 days prior to the `epochEndDate` and the `votingPeriodStartDate` to 10 days prior to the `epochEndDate`, with the `epochEndDate` falling at 23:59:29 on December 31st, 2022.

## Rationale

<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs. The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

- There exists two methods for altering the above variables, `modifyEpochSchedule` and `tweakEpochSchedule`. The first of these is the more drastic, requiring a SIP rather than an SCCP. The reason for having chosen the SIP route is because it allows the `maxAdjustmentTolerance`, which is currently set at 604800 seconds (7 days), to be exceeded. Of the three variables being changed, `nominationPeriodStartDate` exceeds this limit and thus requires a SIP. Therefore, in order to avoid the creation of an unnecessary SCCP, all the changes have been incorporated within this single SIP used to appropriately authorize them.
