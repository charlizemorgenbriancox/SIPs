## Simple Summary

This SIP proposes the addition of several yield tokens as LP collateral on Arbitrum V3 deployment, including aArbUSDC, aArbWETH, aArbWBTC, and aArbUSDT from Aave and wstETH from Lido.

## Abstract

In order to enhance the diversity of yield-generation and exposure options for LP collateral within the Synthetix ecosystem, this SIP aims to add the following yield tokens as supported collateral types for the Arbitrum V3 deployment:

### Aave
- aArbUSDC (0x625e7708f30ca75bfd92586e17077590c60eb4cd)
- aArbWBTC (0x078f358208685046a11c85e8ad32895ded33a249)
- aArbWETH (0xe50fA9b3c56FfB159cB0FCA61F5c9D750e8128c8)
- aArbUSDT (0x6ab707aca953edaefbc4fd23ba73294241490620)

### Lido
- wstETH (0x5979D7b546E38E414F7E9822514be443A4800529)

## Motivation

The addition of these yield tokens aims to:
- Increase the variety of assets available to LP.
- Attract users of different protocols to the Synthetix ecosystem.
- Enhance the overall liquidity on Arbitrum V3 deployment.

### Configurable Values

Each LP parameter (LP cap, minimum minting c-ratio, liquidation ratio) will be configured via SCCP.
