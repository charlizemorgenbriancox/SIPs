## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the SCCP.-->

This SIP proposes the following:

A) Drop the `acceptablePrice` check on order commitment

B) Use the on-chain price, without any staleness tolerance check, when `settleOrder` calls `requiredCredit`

C) Allow for 0 fee perp trading

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the variable change proposed.-->

A) [`acceptablePriceExceeded`](https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix-v3/blob/3912d2f61dd6c7f7c29e750b7f116804027b0965/markets/perps-market/contracts/storage/AsyncOrder.sol#L302) is thrown whenever the limit price is worse than the users' `fillPrice` upon order commitment and settle. As per ERC-7421, integrators are required to push for a fresh price update when the staleness error is thrown (for write transactions). However, the concept of `acceptablePrice` might require a fresh price to be include on commitment, in order for the acceptablePrice value to be relevant during times of volatility. Hence removing this check, on commitment is necessary in order to simplify the order execution pattern for integrators and decrease the gas cost associated with order execution.

B) [SIP-354](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-354) introduced a requirement that all markets, in a given supermarket, are not in a stale state, upon order settlement. This cause issues, given that keepers are compensated for updating 1 price per order. Furthermore, when a user commits to an order, staleness is only checked against the position being altered.  This SIP proposes incorporate a new staleness check requirement `INFINITE` which uses the last pushed price when [settleOrder](https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix-v3/blob/434b685c49db22ddc24cffa07a6b3fbfb8f0df17/markets/perps-market/contracts/modules/AsyncOrderSettlementPythModule.sol#L46) calls [requiredCredit](https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix-v3/blob/9b410c97cc1afee9c0c0c4ced5a1e652369bf36f/markets/perps-market/contracts/storage/PerpsMarket.sol#L431C77-L431C86). Note that all other calls to the `requiredCredit` function remain the same with respect to staleness tolerance.


C) Currently the perp markets do no support 0 fee in trading, because of a `_checkZeroAddressOrAmount` check done upon withdrawing collateral from core contracts. This is addressed in this [PR](https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix-v3/pull/2110) which results in skipping over the fee distribution, in case the amount zero. 

## Motivation

<!--The motivation is critical for SCCPs that want to update variables within Synthetix. It should clearly explain why the existing variable is not incentive aligned. SCCP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->

The motivation of this sip, is to incorporate requests from CC's and integrators into Perps V3 in order to allow it to be integrated smoothly within the different frameworks.
