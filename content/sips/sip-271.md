## Simple Summary

In preparation for the Ethereum merge event, expected to take place on [15-September](https://bordel.wtf/), this SIP proposes to suspend all Synthetix contracts on both Ethereum and Optimism, when Total Terminal Difficulty (TTD) crosses  `58740000000000000000000`, around 3 hours prior to the expected merge block and resume activites after ensuring that Chainlink feeds and the rest of the protocol is in a stable state.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the SIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the SIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

The system would be suspended by running the following functions on both ethereum and optimism:
- [suspendIssuance](https://etherscan.io/address/0x696c905F8F8c006cA46e9808fE7e00049507798F#writeContract#F17)
- [suspendExchange](https://etherscan.io/address/0x696c905F8F8c006cA46e9808fE7e00049507798F#writeContract#F13)
- [suspendFutures](https://etherscan.io/address/0x696c905F8F8c006cA46e9808fE7e00049507798F#writeContract#F14)
- [setPaused (CollateralManager)](https://etherscan.io/address/0x067e398605E84F2D0aEEC1806e62768C5110DCc6#writeContract#F18)
- [setPaused (ETH Wrapper)](https://etherscan.io/address/0xcea392596f1ab7f1d6f8f241967094ca519e6129#writeContract#F6)
- [setPaused (LUSD Wrapper)](https://etherscan.io/address/0x7c22547779c8aa41bae79e03e8383a0befbcecf0#writeContract#F6)

## Motivation

<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the SIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the SIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is innaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the SIP will address the issue!-->

In order to ensure the smooth transition to the new network, the system would be suspended in preparation of the merge block and resumed on the new chain afer ensuring that all aspects of the protocol and price oracles are in a steady state. 

## Specification

The following checks would be performed on a forked chain (with [canon](https://usecannon.com/)) before unsuspending the system:
- Minting and burning debt can take place normally, with the debt pool oracle in line with size of debt
- Both atomic and non-atomic exchange tests would be performed to ensure that the outputted amounts are reasonable  
- Test on opening new loans with ETH and repaying that loan to release the ETH
- Test on opening futures positions, modifying that position and closing that position to release the margin
- ETH and LUSD can be wrapped and released

Due to protocol external dependencies, additional checks would be performed:
- All Chainlink oracles configured within Synthetix are pushing prices that are within a reasonable margin from centralized exchange prices or off-chain calculated expected prices
- LUSD price is close to 1$
- renBTC price is close to the price of wBTC

Once the Synthetix Network on PoS chain is unpaused, if the PoS chain, bears a chain id different from `1`, then the PoW chain will be subsequently unpaused.
