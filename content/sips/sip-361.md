## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the SCCP.-->

This SIP proposes the following:

A) Drop the [`getReportedDebt`](https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix-v3/blob/dcba4ade51c893b7eda5f50657ba4e10dd435fa6/protocol/synthetix/contracts/modules/core/MarketManagerModule.sol#L301) from the event emitted upon withdrawing sUSD from a given perp market.

B) Incorporate a `getOpenPositionSize` that returns the size of a open position given a market id and account number as input

C) Emit an event when an account is flagged for liquidation

D) Incorporate a view function that returns the settlement keeping costs plus the settlement reward

E) Require a strict staleness tolerance on margin withdrawal

F) Incorporate a required margin for order given a execution price

G) Incorporate a secondary cap on open interest denominated in USD

H) Remove the minimum keeping fees from `getRequiredAccountMargins` function


## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the variable change proposed.-->

A) The `getReportedDebt` function requires that all the market prices, in a given supermarket, be not stale. This can be problematic for large supermarkets, as the cost of updating the prices of many markets, that don't exhibit much trading activity, can be significant.

B) `getOpenPositionSize` would be a view function that reads on the storage slot that holds the keepers position information given a certain `marektId` as input as done [here](https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix-v3/blob/main/markets/perps-market/contracts/modules/PerpsAccountModule.sol#L111C1-L114C1)


C) A event emitted under right after an account is flagged for [liquidation](https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix-v3/blob/main/markets/perps-market/contracts/modules/LiquidationModule.sol#L54) which includes the following information:


1. availableMargin

2. requiredMaintenanceMargin

3. liquidationReward

4. account id

D) Create a view functions that takes in the settlement strategy id and returns the [keeping cost](https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix-v3/blob/main/markets/perps-market/contracts/storage/AsyncOrder.sol#L313C1-L315C1) associated with an async order. The keeping costs includes the keeper reward as well as the relevant gas costs.

E)  When a accounts withdraws margin from a market, requires a strict 1 minute staleness tolerance on the the associated position prices in order to mitigate the risk with stale oracles

F) Create a view function that provides integrators with the required margin given any execution price. This would allow estimation of required margin give a price impact from a potential trade that is yet to be executed.

G) Incorporate a secondary USD cap on margins allows to control the oi on a market regardless of the price of the listed asset. The cap applied would be the minimum between the size denominated the assets' native currency and a given USD cap  

H) Remove the minimum keeper fee from `getRequiredAccountMargins` which allows users to withdraw all the margin when they close all their open positions


## Motivation

<!--The motivation is critical for SCCPs that want to update variables within Synthetix. It should clearly explain why the existing variable is not incentive aligned. SCCP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->

The motivation of this sip, is to incorporate requests from CC's and integrators into Perps V3 in order to allow it to be integrated smoothly within the different frameworks.

## Specification

<!--The specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature, there are five sections
1. Overview

3. Technical Specification
4. Test Cases
5. Configurable Values
