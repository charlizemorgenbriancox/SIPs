### Simple Summary

Add AAVE, and UNI Synths on Optimism.

### Overview

This SIP proposes to add AAVE and UNI tokens on Optimism for trading and shorting.

### Motivation

Listing these additional synths on OE will benefit traders on Synthetix and within the ecosystem as a whole. By listing synths that weâ€™ve never had before, we have the opportunity to attract new traders and to increase the trading volume of the overall Synthetix ecosystem.

### Rationale

Synths tracking AAVE, and UNI were chosen after consultation with Synthetix ecosystem partners and the community.
