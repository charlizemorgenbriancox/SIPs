## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

Add a capability to allow markets to prevent withdrawal of delegated collateral without accumulating debt.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the SIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the SIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

The current implementation of a market allows for covering most use cases of credit delegation. However, there are some now established use-cases where a market
may want to reasonably prevent withdrawals (aka "locking") of collateral in order to ensure potentially later assumed debt can be honored.

Note that this functionality only kicks in when a user or pool is withdrawing from a market. It does not have any enforcement on regular collateral price fluctuation, and it will not prevent from *depositing* new collateral into a pool.

## Motivation

<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the SIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the SIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is inaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the SIP will address the issue!-->

There are some cases where it is necessary for a market to control withdrawal of collateral. Some examples:

* for a spot market, the market may want to ensure it always has a certain margin of collateral available to prevent insolvency, though such a circumstance is unlikely.
* for a insurance-based market (AKA, a market which pays out for some sort of loss with pools acting as a counterparty), when a user buys an policy, it is important that they can have confidence that the market can pay-up in the case of a subsequent loss. Without a locking-mechanism, a pool user, or a pool itself, could withdraw liquidity if it looks like a loss is imminent, for example.

## Technical Specification

<!--The specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature, there are five sections
1. Overview
2. Rationale
3. Technical Specification
4. Test Cases
5. Configurable Values
-->

### Overview

<!--This is a high level overview of *how* the SIP will solve the problem. The overview should clearly describe how the new feature will be implemented.-->

Implementation entails adding functions that markets may call to deposit and withdraw collateral, adding SCCP-configurable values to limit the amount of depositable collateral on a per-market basis, and updating the debt and credit calculations pertaining to markets accordingly.

### Rationale

<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs. The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

It is necessary to cap the amount of deposited collateral because...

### Technical Specification

<!--The technical specification should outline the public API of the changes proposed. That is, changes to any of the interfaces Synthetix currently exposes or the creations of new ones.-->

The `Market` interface is modified to add a new function, `locked(uint128) external view`, which is called by the core system to asses the quantity of collateral value
which should be locked from withdrawal. Markets which do not need this functionality can simply return `0`.

The `MarketManager` introduces a new concept, "capacity lock", which is a boolean state defined as `self.capacity < Market.locked(marketId)`, where `Market.locked(marketId)` is the
result of calling the aforementioned `locked`  function on the market, and `self.capacity` is the currently allocated capacity as defined in SIP-303. The capacity lock
state ultimately determines whether a withdrawal/deleverage can take place.

If an account calls `delegateCollateral` with a decreased `collateralAmount` or `leverage` from the position to the position prior to the call, the call will revert
if any of the markets attached to the pool are capacity locked.

If a pool owner calls `setPoolConfiguration` with a decreased `weight` or `maxDebtPerShare` for a market, the call will revert if the corresponding market
is collateral locked.

Note that the above conditions only apply for withdrawals/deleverage relative to the pool. If a user/pool increases its position, this may be done without satisfying the capacity lock condition.

### Test Cases

<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for SIPs but can be included with the implementation..-->

Tests will be added to existing cases for `setPoolConfiguration()` and `delegateCollateral()` to the appropriate branch conditions
to verify the lock conditions are satisfied for a variety of locking cases.

### Configurable Values (Via SCCP)

<!--Please list all values configurable via SCCP under this implementation.-->

No new SCCP values are added by this specification.
