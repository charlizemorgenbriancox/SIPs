## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

This SIP seeks to establish the concept of an emergency election conducted mid-epoch, to be used to replace members of the various Synthetix councils without the necessity of triggering a full election period.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the SIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the SIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

The implementation of the V3 Governance Module (V3GM) with [SIP-266](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-266/) and the formalization of a minimum number of active council members through the passing of [SCCP-300](https://sips.synthetix.io/sccp/sccp-300/) have established the concept of an election held outside of the election period that occurs at the conclusion of an epoch. Though this “emergency election” now exists in principle, the process by which it would be conducted remains undocumented. Given that the bar for triggering such an election is relatively low, requiring only one member of any of the councils being deemed inactive (through either voluntary exit, absence or dismissal), remedying this is a priority. This SIP seeks to propose an efficient means of maintaining council integrity by establishing the procedures for conducting an “emergency election,” which, from hereon in, will be referred to as a mid-epoch election.

## Specification

<!--The specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature, there are five sections
1. Overview
2. Rationale

5. Configurable Values
-->

According to SCCP-300, when the (`minimumActiveMembers`) threshold for any council is hit (set at n-1 at the time of this SIPs creation) an election is triggered and takes place midway through the current epoch. Rather than proceeding with a time-consuming and disruptive election cycle, this SIP proposes capitalizing on the on-chain records of results from the last election period in order to determine and assign a suitable candidate to fill the vacant spot. In addition, it also proposes that the election component of this mid-epoch election be a Spartan Council vote to ratify the candidate sourced from data held on the previous epochal election.

The procedure would be as follows:

1)	A mid-epoch election is tiggered when the (`minimumActiveMembers`) number is met or exceeded for any of the Synthetix councils.

2)	The Spartan Council looks or is asked to look to the data held on the last epochal election and seeks to establish the availability of the account with the greatest received voting power that is not currently on the relevant council but that was a nominee during that council’s election.

3)	A meta-governance SCCP is created that specifies the replacement of the non-active council member with next available nominee in line. As it is a meta-governance SCCP, it would require unanimous agreement on the part of Spartan Council. Should it be a Spartan Councillor who is being replaced, SIP-263 allows unanimity to be established without all original Spartan Councillors voted into the role for that epoch submitting positive votes, thus allowing the process to proceed efficiently.

4)	Upon the SCCP vote passing, the council owner transfers the relevant NFT to the replacement and the epoch continues.

5)	Once the mid-epoch election has concluded, the epoch proceeds and concludes as usual, with all council members required to renominate themselves for the following epoch (should they wish to run).

## Rationale

The reason for implementing this SIP’s proposed response to mid-epoch elections is that it reduces the overhead on the protocol, with epochal elections already consuming several weeks of attention, while still deferring to the community’s will in determining who fills council seats. Having the Spartan Council ratify the replacement by electing them using a meta-governance SCCP also provides an opportunity for oversight in a process that might otherwise be opaque through being carried out within inter-council communications. Lastly, it provides a motivation for promising though unsuccessful council nominees to remain engaged with the project despite not having been initially chosen for a spot.

## Test Cases

Using results sourced from the election for the last epoch of 2022, we can see that, were Treasury Candidate 1 to be dismissed, Treasury Candidate 5 would be contacted. Once Treasury Candidate 5’s availability to serve on the Treasury Council had been reaffirmed, the election process outlined above would be carried out.
