## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

This SIP proposes adding functionality that allows markets to prevent withdrawal of delegated collateral.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the SIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the SIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

This functionality allows a market to specify an amount of dollar-denominated credit under which pools are unable to remove the collateral/liquidity they are providing to it. This only applies when an account or pool is withdrawing from a market. It does not directly consider factor in collateral price fluctuations and it will not prevent from increasing the liquidity provided to a pool or market.

## Motivation

<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the SIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the SIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is inaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the SIP will address the issue!-->

There are some cases where it is necessary for a market to control withdrawal of collateral. Some examples:

- In a spot market implementation, the market may want to ensure it always has a certain margin of collateral available to prevent insolvency from sudden price fluctuations.
- In an insurance market implmentation, purchasers of a policy may want a guarantee that backers are not able to withdraw all of the liquidity if claims appear imminent.

## Technical Specification

<!--The specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature, there are five sections
1. Overview
2. Rationale
3. Technical Specification
4. Test Cases
5. Configurable Values
-->

### Overview

<!--This is a high level overview of *how* the SIP will solve the problem. The overview should clearly describe how the new feature will be implemented.-->

The implementation involves adding a new function to the market interface, which specifies the amount of credit under which the lock should be applied, and updates to the core system that respect these values.

### Rationale

<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs. The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

A major benefit of this approach is that it allows a market to dynamically calculate a `locked` value (as opposed to requiring a function call on the market manager to update the value). This allows a market to consider dynamic values, such as price fluctuations, when calculating an amount to lock. The locked value is dollar-denominated (rather than denominated in the collateral types) because it greatly simplifies implementation, is future-proof to the addition of new collateral types, and still allows the composition of collateral backing a market to be considered in the calculation of its locked value.

### Technical Specification

<!--The technical specification should outline the public API of the changes proposed. That is, changes to any of the interfaces Synthetix currently exposes or the creations of new ones.-->

The `IMarket` interface is modified to add a new function, `function locked(uint128 marketId) external view returns (uint);`. This is called by the core system to assess the amount of collateral value that should be locked from withdrawal. Markets that do not need this functionality can simply return `0`.

The `MarketManager` introduces a new concept, _capacity lock_, which is a boolean state defined as `self.capacity < Market.locked(marketId)`. `Market.locked(marketId)` is the amount returned by the market's `locked` function and `self.capacity` is amount of liquidity/credit current allocated to the market (per [SIP-303](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-303/)). The capacity lock state determines whether a withdrawal/deleverage can take place.

If any market in a given pool is capacity locked, a call to `delegateCollateral` with a decreased `collateralAmount` or `leverage` for this pool with revert. Calls to `setPoolConfiguration` with a decreased `weight` or `maxDebtPerShare` for the relevant market will also revert. Increasing the amount of the credit provided to a pool or market in both of these circumstances will work per usual.

### Test Cases

<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for SIPs but can be included with the implementation..-->

Tests will be added to existing cases for `setPoolConfiguration()` and `delegateCollateral()` to demonstrate that the `locked` value is handled appropriately.

### Configurable Values (Via SCCP)

<!--Please list all values configurable via SCCP under this implementation.-->
