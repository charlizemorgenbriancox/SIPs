## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

End SNX token inflation.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the SIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the SIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

If this SIP is implemented, inflation will be reduced to zero in the claim week following the vote. This change only requires a parameter to be updated so it can be implemented fairly quickly.

## Motivation

<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the SIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed; if the SIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is inaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the SIP will address the issue!-->

Inflation was introduced in 2019 to incentivise staking in the recently deployed Synthetix network, following the pivot from Havven. It was critical the staking ratio was high in the early period of the network to scale liquidity. This incentive loop was incredibly effective and led to a multi-year bull market in Synthetix liquidity and network growth. Yet in recent years the effectiveness of this incentive has declined significantly; with inflation now in low single digits it does not meaningfully impact staker behaviour.

## Specification

<!--The specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature, there are five sections
1. Overview
2. Rationale
3. Technical Specification
4. Test Cases
5. Configurable Values
-->

### Overview

<!--This is a high level overview of *how* the SIP will solve the problem. The overview should clearly describe how the new feature will be implemented.-->

The weekly SNX inflation will be reduced to zero.

### Rationale

<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs. The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

Given the recently proposed experiment to buyback and burn SNX using fees generated by the Andromeda deployment to Base, it is counterproductive to continue inflation. This is because inflation will likely outweigh issuance until volume on Andromeda scales. By reducing inflation to zero, any non-zero fee yield on Base will result in the SNX token being deflationary.

There has been significant discussion about the effectiveness of buybacks vs paying yield to stakers. I have historically been against buybacks because they reduce the incentive to stake. This is an issue given the need to maximise SNX collateral backing the Synthetix network. However, I have updated my view on this as I believe high inflation and the complexity of staking has created a strong disincentive for new participants to hold the SNX token. The incentives are arguably too strongly skewed against passive token holders. The combination of buybacks and zero inflation shifts the incentives towards accommodating passive holders.

There are many paths the network can take in the upcoming year, including the deployment of an app chain and the deprecation of SNX as the primary collateral. These approaches are possible regardless of whether the token is inflationary. Halting inflation does not impact any of these pathways significantly. Given all of these considerations, it appears inflation is detrimental to the continued growth of the network.

### Technical Specification

<!--The technical specification should outline the public API of the changes proposed. That is, changes to any of the interfaces Synthetix currently exposes or the creations of new ones.-->

This is a parameter change to the weekly inflation amount, as such it does not impact any interfaces.

### Test Cases

<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for SIPs but can be included with the implementation..-->

TBC, however, we must ensure there is no impact to setting the inflation rate to null.

### Configurable Values (Via SCCP)

<!--Please list all values configurable via SCCP under this implementation.-->
