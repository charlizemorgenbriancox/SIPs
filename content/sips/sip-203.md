## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

Introduce a target staking ratio incentivised through inflation.

## Abstract

This SIP will track the staking ratio within the network and modify the inflation rate weekly to ensure this target ratio is achieved. The staking ratio will be measured as the percentage of SNX collateral in staked addresses divided by the total SNX collateral.

## Motivation

Prior to the introduction of the SIP process an inflation rate was introduced via a discord vote, this inflation rate was subsequently adjusted by SIP-23. The purpose of the inflation rate was to encourage a high staking rate with the network was growing. This worked well with the inflation rate peaking at 90%+. The staking ratio has subsequently fallen to below 70% as inflation has declined based on the curve specified in SIP-23. This SIP looks to introduce a target ratio for staking of 85% and adjust the inflation weekly up or down by 5% depending on whether the staking ratio is below or above the target ratio in order to hit this target, if the actual ratio is within 5% of the target ratio no adjustment will be made.

## Specification

<!--The specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature, there are five sections
1. Overview
2. Rationale
3. Technical Specification
4. Test Cases
5. Configurable Values
-->

### Overview

<!--This is a high level overview of *how* the SIP will solve the problem. The overview should clearly describe how the new feature will be implemented.-->

Each epoch the staking ratio for the previous epoch will be measured at the time of the inflation emmission, if the ratio is below the target ratio by more than 5% then the previous weekly inflation amount will be adjusted up by 5%, if it above teh target ratio then inflation will be reduced by 5%. 

### Rationale

<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs. The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

Rather than attempting to modify the inflation curve to increase the staking ratio it is better to introduce a mechanism which targets the specific outcome the inflation rate is intented to achieve. The buffer and rate adjustment variables can be adjusted via SCCP based on the responsiveness of the network to this feedback loop.

### Technical Specification

<!--The technical specification should outline the public API of the changes proposed. That is, changes to any of the interfaces Synthetix currently exposes or the creations of new ones.-->

TBC

### Test Cases

<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for SIPs but can be included with the implementation..-->

TBC

### Configurable Values (Via SCCP)

<!--Please list all values configurable via SCCP under this implementation.-->

Buffer rate: 5%
Rate adjustment: 5%
