## Summary

There are now a number of protocols integrating with Synthetix on Optimism, this trend is only expected to accelerate this year. The lack of sustainable revenue from these integrations is an impediment to growth. Adding a Source Fee at the protocol level will allow integrators to capture fees from the volume they route through Synthetix.

## Abstract

An optional source fee will be added as a transaction parameter that can be passed from any front-end to the Synthetix Exchange Contracts.

## Motivation

The current approach to Synthetix ecosystem partners is to leverage the volume program which pays out monthly rewards in SNX to integrators based on the volume generated. The issue with this program is that it does not scale linearly with volume so there is limited upside for integrators generating large volumes. By splitting the exchange fee into a Protocol Fee and Source Fee we can ensure that the upfront integration effort is worthwhile for potential ecosystem partners. This will create a reliance on revenue generated via a Synthetix integration and further reinforce the reliance of these protocols on Synthetix volume creating strongly aligned incentives throughout the ecosystem.

## Specification

The transaction fee variable will be split into two parts, a base level Protocol Fee (which does not include dynamic fees) and an optional Source Fee that can be triggered by a frontend passing a Volume Partner code to the Exchange Contracts. This reduces the likelihood of the code being bypassed since the total fee paid by the user remains the same. The Source Fee will be set by the Volume Partner and will be added on top of the existing base fee. There will be no restrictions surrounding utilization of the Source Fee.
