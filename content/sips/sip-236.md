## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

Exchanger.exchange does not use the post-reclaim amount to calculate the amount of exchange for the
user trade. This leads to the user being left with more of their source token then they should
have had.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the SIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the SIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "We propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

Exchanger.exchange does not use the post-reclaim amount to calculate the amount of exchange for the
user trade. This leads to the user being left with more of their source token then they should
have had.

A similar bug has been found `ExchangerWithFeeRecAlternatives` that would affect L1, and will be similarly patched.

### Tests

In `Exchanger` tests, the following are added:

* settlement tests
  * trade sUSD->sEUR
    * sEUR price doubles
      * -> trade from sEUR->sBTC results in amount after fee reclamation
    * sEUR price halves
      * -> trade from sBTC->sEUR results in amount after fee reclamation
