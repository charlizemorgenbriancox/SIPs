## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

Expands [SIP-104](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-104/) to propose the formalization of when a Meta-Governance proposal fails to reach consensus when dilution occurs.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the SIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the SIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "We propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

This SIP will expand [SIP-104](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-104/) to include the definition for when a Meta-Governance Proposal and Governance Proposals to the following

Council members who lose more than 50% of their backing via dilution will lose their voting power. Therefore for Meta-Governance votes, any council member that loses more than 50% of his voting power results in a `Rejected` status. For Governance votes, given the threshold of `n/2+1` if n is even or `(n+1)/2+1` if n is odd, a council member that loses 50% of his voting power loses his voting power. Therefore, in order for Governance vote to pass, a sip/sccp needs to have at least threshold number of council members voting favorably AND none of them being diluted by more than 50%.

## Motivation

<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the SIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the SIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is inaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the SIP will address the issue!-->

As a consequence of the implementation of [SIP-191](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-191/) which removed the cost friction of dilution, certain Council Members experienced dilution in multiple proposals which were negligible (<= 0.01/1).

Upon this realization, the community found that there was not a formal definition on how dilution effects Meta-Governance proposals, with SIP-104 only providing a formal definition of dilution for super-majority (SIPs that were not Meta-Governance), leaving some confusion whether a Meta-Governance was invalidated or not.

This proposal was then motivated by the need to define whether a proposal is a result of actual dilution of griefing.

## Specification

<!--The specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature, there are five sections
1. Overview
2. Rationale
3. Technical Specification
4. Test Cases
5. Configurable Values
-->

### Overview

<!--This is a high-level overview of *how* the SIP will solve the problem. The overview should clearly describe how the new feature will be implemented-->

SIP-202 amends [SIP-104](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-104/) to expand the invalidation requirements for Meta-Governance and Governance proposals.

### Rationale

<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs? The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

Considering that Meta-Governance proposals require a unanimous decision (i.e with 8 members, all 8 members need to agree on a decision), we could not re-use the same definition as normal proposals. This definition balances the consideration of griefing as an governance attack-vector with an achievable dilution target.

### Technical Specification

If SIP-202 is approved, it will be considered a mandatory addition (amendment) to [SIP-104](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-104/).

### Configurable Values (Via SCCP)

<!--Please list all values configurable via SCCP under this implementation.-->

- Threshold in which a single Council Member needs to be diluted by
