## Simple Summary

The sip proposes to implement the following:
- `allMarketSummaries` function, provides an overview of all markets, however, the introduction of funding rate velocity resulted in `allMarketSummaries` calls to revert, as legacy markets don't have this concept of velocity.
- Removal of the ability of accounts to interact with their position and margin, if there are pending orders that are yet to be executed.
- Immediate cancellation of pending orders when an account is flagged for liquidation. 

## Motivation

The motivation as as follows:
- `allMarketSummaries` is necessary as it provides an overview of all markets, both legacy & v2 markets in a single contract call.
- Margin & positions should not be allowed to be changed, if an order committed to is yet to be executed, in order to protect against abuse. 
- In order to ensure that liquidations take place without delay, this sips incorporates the ability to immediately cancel pending orders upon flag.

## Specification

### All Market Summaries Fix

Legacy markets would be assigned a value of 0 for funding rate velocity under `allMarketSummaries()`.

### Modifier For Delayed Orders

A modifier is incorporated into the `_transferMargin_`, `_modifyPosition_` and `_closePosition`, checking if pending orders are yet to be executed on a given account before applying the change: 

```
    modifier onlyIfNotPendingOrder() {
        require(marketState.delayedOrders(messageSender).sizeDelta == 0, "Pending order exists");
        _;
    }
```

### Cancellation of Pending Orders On Flag

When an account is flagged, pending orders are cancelled and the `minKeeperFee` set aside for execution/cancellation of the order is paid to the account flagging.
