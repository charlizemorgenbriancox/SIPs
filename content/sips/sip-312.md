## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

This SIP proposes functionality that enables pools to back markets on any chain with a Synthetix core system deployment.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the SIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the SIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

This entails use of an on-demand oracle and cross-chain messaging to allow an unlimited number of pools to synthesize their debt and credit across an arbitrary number of chains. Functions that require cross-chain data on-demand will comply with [EIP-3668](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3668).

## Motivation

<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the SIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the SIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is inaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the SIP will address the issue!-->

This proposal aims to achieve equivalent functionality to [SIP-165](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-165/) but for an unlimited number of permissionless pools without requiring custom oracles or creating additional trust assumptions.

Depending on the availability of an on-demand oracle suited to the specification below, we may propose implementing cross-chain pool synthesis in a manner more similar to [SIP-165](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-165/) only for pools specified by governance as an interim solution.

## Technical Specification

<!--The specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature, there are five sections
1. Overview
2. Rationale
3. Technical Specification
4. Test Cases
5. Configurable Values
-->

### Overview

<!--This is a high level overview of *how* the SIP will solve the problem. The overview should clearly describe how the new feature will be implemented.-->

With cross-chain messaging, the protocol is able to synchronize configuration settings across chains. With an on-demand oracle, smart contracts would be able to receive data from other chains in a trustless and decentralized manner. Relying on these systems, the protocol can be updated to achieve cross-chain pool synthesis, as outlined below.

### Rationale

<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs. The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

This proposal entails synthesizing pools across chains, rather than other entities in the system. Markets exist outside of the core system and therefore not under consideration. Accounts and their staking positions will stay unique per chain, as this ensures it is always possible to clearly associate an account with all of the staked collateral on a particular deployment of Synthetix.

### Technical Specification

<!--The technical specification should outline the public API of the changes proposed. That is, changes to any of the interfaces Synthetix currently exposes or the creations of new ones.-->

#### On-Demand Oracle

This system depends on an _on-demand oracle_. This is a decentralized oracle system which is able to fulfill network requests off-chain. The request could specify data to read from all chains with a Synthetix core system deployment. The return data would consist of a signed blob of data including the requested data. This blob can then be provided as parameter for on-chain functions, have the signature cryptographically verified, and then have the data cached if necessary. These off-chain data sources will be specified in compliance with [EIP-3668](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3668).

#### Core Protocol Updates

References to markets throughout the protocol would be updated such that they include a `chainId` in addition to a `marketId`. The following functions would be updated accordingly:

- `createPool()` - Trigger CCIP messages (broadcast to all chains with a Synthetix V3 core protocol deployment) to create a pool with same ID and owner on other chains. If the ID conflicts with another request to create a pool, the message with the lowest timestamp will take priority.
- `setPoolConfiguration()` - Broadcast the new configuration to all chains for a given pool, have them receive the message, and update accordingly.
- `delegateCollateral()` - This function will receive data from the on-demand oracle to use when determining the collateral and debt associated with the relevant pool.
- `liquidate()` and `liquidateVault()` - Both of these functions will receive data from the on-demand oracle to determine the current total collateralization for the relevant staking position or vault.

_For adjustments where pool liquidity is being reduced, the off-chain oracle must be leveraged to prove that sufficient collateral is not locked by markets, per [SIP-309](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-309/)._

### Test Cases

<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for SIPs but can be included with the implementation..-->

Relevant tests will be developed during implementation.

### Configurable Values (Via SCCP)

<!--Please list all values configurable via SCCP under this implementation.-->
