## Simple Summary

The sip proposes to put in place a new gas fee logic, which replaces the one currently implemented under [SIP-362](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-362/). The new implementation would incorporate the necessary changes in transaction costs associated with optimism's [Fjord upgrade](https://docs.optimism.io/builders/notices/fjord-changes). Depending on governance, base is  is expected to update their gas pricing mechanism on July 10th at 16:00:01 UTC. However, the [`OpGasPriceOracle`](https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix-v3/blob/main/auxiliary/OpGasPriceOracle/contracts/OpGasPriceOracle.sol) contract would incorporate a isFjord function and automically switches to the new contract calculation when Fjord is released.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the SIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the SIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

Implements the new gas price logic relies on the optimism documentation, where the cost of executing a transaction would be based on the below calculation:

```
costOfExecutionGross := (l2GasPrice * l2GasUnits + l1GasCost)

where

l1GasCost = getL1FeeUpperBound(unsignedTxSize)

```
With the rest of the components in terms of obtaining the parameters from the [base gas contract](https://basescan.org/address/0x420000000000000000000000000000000000000F), the conversion to USD via the ETH/USD node, the upper and lower bounds on gas price compensation unchanged.

## Motivation

The main motivation is to update the protocol, as per the Ecotone specification in order to continue to incentivize keepers to perform keeping tasks.

## Specification

Pending.

### Configurable Values (Via SCCP)

Aside from existing parameters from the current implementation, the below parameter would be added:
- `unsignedTxSize`  size of the unsigned fully [RLP-encoded transaction](https://sepolia-optimism.etherscan.io/getRawTx?tx=0x6b614d3dd27c66b98f83055108509a8fcdaf9cc2924878345cb49ac3d91e338b) for settling an offchain delayed order

The initial configuration of `unsignedTxSize` parameter would be 5000.

## Test Cases

Will be setup after the testnet release.
