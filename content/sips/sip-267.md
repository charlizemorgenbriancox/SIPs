## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

This SIP proposes to implement a direct integration contract that allows integrators to tap into Synthetix's exchange functionalities with a customized set parameters.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the SIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the SIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

The direct integration contract allows the Synthetix protocol to create a unique enviroment for integrators, allowing access to Synthetix's exchange functionalities with custom parameters that fit individual use cases. Although this sip is built on top of v2x, it fits in the spirit of what we should expect with Synthetix v3, where different markets can be created and tailored for specific offerings and use cases.

## Motivation
<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the SIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the SIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is innaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the SIP will address the issue!-->

There are a number of benefits to the Synthetix protocol from having a direct integration path with partners:
- Lyra's uses Synthetix's exchange functionalities in to offer it's users options trading venue with an integrated amm model which embeds slippage.
- Curve  also provides Synthetix with pools that allow for cross-asset swaps with built-in slippage. 

Both these protocols have a significantly reduced chance of latency attacks, due to their protocol's incorporation of slippage constraining toxic flow to a certain extent. Providing these special `DirectIntegration` routes into Synthetix's exchange functionalities isolates the trade flow to a certain extent and allows us to offer more competitive offerings via lower fees.

## Specification

<!--The specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature, there are five sections
1. Overview
2. Rationale
3. Technical Specification
4. Test Cases
5. Configurable Values
-->

### Technical Specification

The `DirectIntegration` contract allows the Spartan Council to approve an external contract, not owned or managed by the Synthetix protocol, to interact with the Synthetix's core exchange functionalities at specified parameters. If no parameter overrides were specified, the prevailing parameter configuration would be automatically used. Below are the functionalities configurable within the `DirectIntegration` contract:

#### Add / Remove Integration
`addIntegration` and `removeIntegration` functions, which take in 2 arguments :
- The `address` of the external integrators' contract
- An identifier of the exchange functionality that could be tapped by the external contract (example `exchangeAtomically`). 

By calling `addIntegration` the external contract can interact with the synthetix exchange functionality at the default parameters that are currently on-chain. While calling `removeIntegration` on the other hand, removes the external contract address as well as all pre-configured overridden parameters related to that external contract from memory.

#### Add Override on Parameters
`addOverride` is a function that takes in the following arguments:
- The address of the external contract  
- An identifier of the parameter to be overridden (example `setAtomicExchangeFeeRate`)
- A list that make -- The address of the external contract  
up the override values. An example of this would be ['sETH',10 bp] which sets fees on atomic exchanges on sETH to 10 bp.

Hence `addOverride` can be used to lower the `exchangeFee` on exchanges with certain synths for integrators. In case an override value needs to be edited, `removeOverride` can be done followed by `addOverride`.

#### Remove Override on Parameters
`removeOverride` is a function that takes in the following arguments:
- The address of the external contract  
- An identifier of a parameter (i.e. `setAtomicExchangeFeeRate`)

Once a remove `override` is set, the default parameters prevailing within the current Synthetix core contracts is used.

#### Get Integration Parameters
The `getIntegrationParameter` function takes in the following arguments:
- The address of the external contract  
- An identifier of a parameter (i.e. `setAtomicExchangeFeeRate`)

This is a getter function that can be used to read the configured parameters on a external contract. 

#### Resume / Pause Integration
The `SystemStatus` would include `resumeIntegration` and `pauseIntegration` functions, that take in the external contract address and allows pdao to suspend and resume interaction with external contracts.

### Parameters Involved

Below is a list of parameters that can be configured via the `DirectIntegration` contract:
- `setDexPriceAggregator`
- `setAtomicExchangeFeeRate`
- `setAtomicMaxVolumePerBlock`
- `setAtomicVolatilityTwapSeconds` [SIP-265](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-265/)
- `setAtomicMaxTwapDelta` [SIP-265](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-265/)
- `setAtomicSlippageScalingFactor` [SIP-266](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-26x/) (yet to be published)
- `setExchangeFeeRateForSynths`
- `setExchangeDynamicFeeWeightDecay`
- `setExchangeDynamicFeeThreshold`
- `setExchangeDynamicFeeRounds`
- `setExchangeMaxDynamicFee`

### Test Cases

<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for SIPs but can be included with the implementation..-->

### Configurable Values (Via SCCP)
<!--Please list all values configurable via SCCP under this implementation.-->
Below is a list of values configurable via `SIP` or `SCCP`:
- `addIntegration`, `addOverride`: These will require a SIP and a presentation, given the importance of clearly presenting external interactions with Synthetix contracts and the parameters overrides that would be implemented.
- `removeOverride` , `resumeIntegration` , `removeIntegration`: These interactions can be configured via `SCCP`.
- `pauseIntegration` can be called by pDAO should it be needed in cases of emergencies.
