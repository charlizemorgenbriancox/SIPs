network:  Ethereum
status: Draft
type: Governance

## Simple Summary

The sip proposes to deprecate classic exchanges (and atomic exchanges) of `sETHBTC`, `sETH` and `sBTC` with a new redeemer contract that redeems users at the chainlink price multiplied by a `discountRate`. This `discountRate` would start at 1 and can be decrease gradually as per a pre-approved schedule that can be voted on by governance with an SCCP.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the SIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the SIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

After this sip is implemented, users holding `sETH`, `sBTC`   or `sETHBTC` can only redeem their synths to `sUSD` at the chainlink price multiplied by the specified discount factor.

## Motivation

The legacy spot synths are overutilsed relative to their value to stakers, they produce minimal revenue and incur significant hedging costs for stakers. Spot synths in V3 have been redesigned to be more aligned with the interests of stakers, this proposal will immediately begin to reduce the debt pool skew, and the costs associated with stakers managing their debt hedging due to changes in the composition of outstanding synths. It also prepares for the migration of debt to V3 later in the year as new products are launched, including the upcoming L1 ETH perp.
