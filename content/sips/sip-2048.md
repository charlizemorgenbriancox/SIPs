# Motivation
<!--You can leave these HTML comments in your merged SIP and delete the visible duplicate text guides, they will not appear and may be helpful to refer to if you edit it again. This is the suggested template for new SIPs. Note that an SIP number will be assigned by an editor. When opening a pull request to submit your SIP, please use an abbreviated title in the filename, `sip-draft_title_abbrev.md`. The title should be 44 characters or less.-->

## Simple Summary
<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

The sip proposes max market value control module that is able to decrease the prevailing `maxMarketValue` to zero on a specified market. The function can only be called by an endorsed account and the `maxMarketValue` parameter can only be restored by the protocol owner. Note that restoring the `maxMarketValue` requires obtaining the necessary governance related sign-off (i.e. SCCP or SIP).

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the SIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the SIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

The module is a standard [Gnosis Safe Module](https://docs.safe.global/safe-smart-account/modules) that inherits control over the `setMaxMarketValue` function in `PerpsV2MarketSettings`.

## Motivation

<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the SIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the SIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is inaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the SIP will address the issue!-->

The proposed module is able to take quick action in order to lower the open interest caps to zero on a given market. This is performed with the help of an off chain script that checks as to whether arbitrages of skew in a perp market is possible. 

## Technical Specification

### coverRisk
This is a function that takes in a Perps V2 `marketKey` and is able to decrease the `maxMarketValue` to zero on that market.

### setEndorsedAccount
This is a setter function that allows the specification of the endorsed account that can call the `coverRisk` function.

### getEndorsedAccount
This is a getter function that returns the currently configured endorsed account.

Note that similar to the case of the gas price module, when ownership of `PerpsV2MarketSettings` is switched over to the L1 safe (during contract updates), the MMV risk control module would be temporarily disabled.  

### Test Cases

<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for SIPs but can be included with the implementation..-->

- When a endorsed account calls the `coverRisk`  function on the `ENJ` market
    - ✅ Then the transaction succeeds and the maxMarketValue of the `ENJ` market is decreased to zero
- When a random  account calls the `coverRisk`  function on the `ENJ` market
    - ❌ Then transaction reverts, as the caller is not endorsed

### Configurable Values (Via SCCP)

<!--Please list all values configurable via SCCP under this implementation.-->
- Updating the endorsed account with the `setEndorsedAccount` requires an SCCP.
