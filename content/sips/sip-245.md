## Simple Summary

This SIP proposes to allow a buffer for burning during the minting cooldown (currently 7 days)    

## Abstract

Allow 50% buffer for burning during cooldown period after minting. Perform a claim on any burn/mint event if possible.  

## Motivation

To improve the UX of staking I propose to leave a buffer on the burn restrictions during minting cooldown. The buffer should have a value of 50% from target cRatio, i.e. one can burn up to 350% cRatio during the cooldown per current system variable (target cRatio being 300%).  

This is particularly important for multisigs which are staking as by the time a 'burn to cRatio' transaction is staged and executed and the transaction to claim follows up, the cratio can easily drop again and thus require another `burn to cRatio` transaction, making for a very bad UX for multisigs.  

I also propose further improvements to stakers' UX:  
- Perform an auto-claim of pending rewards if cRatio allows on any mint or burn event  
- Increase the buffer for claim from 1% from target cRatio to 3%, i.e. more than 291% at current system configuration

## Specification

- Allow a buffer of 50% on burn during minting cooldown
- Perform an auto-claim of pending rewards if cRatio allows on any mint or burn event  
- Increase the buffer for claim from 1% from target cRatio to 3%, i.e. more than 291% at current system configuration

 
### Test Cases

N/A

### Configurable Values (Via SCCP)
- buffer for burn during cooldown = 50%
