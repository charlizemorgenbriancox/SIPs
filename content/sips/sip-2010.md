## Simple Summary

Create ARB-PERP market on Optimism.

## Abstract

This is a proposal to offer ARB-PERP futures which track the price of $ARB token.

## Motivation

$ARB is a highly anticipated token launch which has drawn considerable attention, and will be attractive for traders. As of the creation of this proposal, ARB is not listed on any other perps DEX, and could help motivate new users to try Synthetix Perps and demonstrate the value of the Synthetix system.

### Rationale

Of existing tokens on Synthetix, $ARB is most comparable to $OP. OP-Perp is one of the most traded markets on Synthetix frontends, which demonstrates the market's appetite for newer, especially volatile tokens. $ARB token has seen considerable attention from speculators, and a swift listing of the $ARB token as a Synthetix perps market allows the protocol to take advantage of the attention and narrative surrounding the token's launch.
