## Simple Summary

This SIP proposes a reduction in SNX Inflationary Staking Rewards for both L1 and L2 and a new way of setting up inflationary rewards to have a constant yearly inflation of 20%.  

## Abstract

Reduce inflationary SNX staking rewards on both L1 and L2 to a fixed annual rate  

## Motivation

Current inflation level is at about 50% of total circulating supply, inclusive of escrowed rewards.  

Futures functionality has brought an increase of sUSD fees to stakers with debt stabilisation - approaching neutral thus far.  Staking is expected to become relatively more passive going forward with comparably less risks/debt hedging required.  
  
Drafters believe that a targeted 20% yearly inflation, presumably into perpetuity absent further SC action, that readjusts weekly based on total circulating supply, is an appropriate target.  Compared to SIP-202, this should require less labor from the pDAO, and be thus less susceptible to implementation and maintenance errors.  This outcome should therefore also be more aligned with a greater decentralised status for the operation of the protocol.  


## Specification

#### Fixed Annual $SNX Inflationary Staking Rewards
Current total supply of SNX per coingecko (at the time of writing the SIP) is 266,473,982.  
 
We are proposing a simple formula to calculate new weekly inflation:  

`(totalSupply*1.2 - totalsupply)/52`  

This makes for 20% yearly APR assuming all SNX is staked, or 22.09% APY, thus the actual yearly inflation at any given time is **22.09%**.  
 
We assume this would be relatively simple to implement, but while itâ€™s being implemented and until release, we urge ProtocolDAO to set a fixed inflation rate of what the formula would currently result in as soon as this SIP is voted in (if it does get voted in):  

`(266,473,982 * 1.2 -266,473,982) / 52 =1,024,900 SNX per week`


### Test Cases

N/A

### Configurable Values (Via SCCP)

`Yearly Inflation rate multiplier` = 1.2
