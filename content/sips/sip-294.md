#Simple Summary
<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the SCCP.-->
Increase the 6,000 SNX reward emission to 10,000 SNX per week and redirect the inflation to a wallet controlled by the Treasury Council to incentivize sETH, sBTC, and sUSD Curve pools to promote Atomic Swap adoption.
#Motivation
<!--The motivation is critical for SCCPs that want to update variables within Synthetix. It should clearly explain why the existing variable is not incentive aligned. SCCP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->
Currently, 6,000 SNX is minted per week as a reward for depositing into the sUSD curve pool. This is a direct incentive and is not as capital efficient as incentivizing curve voters on convex or similar protocols. As of now, the protocol could increase its capital efficiency by incentivizing curve voters on convex or similar protocols instead.
Furthermore, Atomic Swaps have just been fine-tuned and are beginning to experience volume flow through Curve, but the current limiting factor is the liquidity for synths on mainnet. To increase liquidity, the Treasury Council will have discretion in allocating this 10,000 SNX per week to the appropriate curve synth pools.
#Technical Specification
The supply schedule for inflation will be adjusted to replace the 6,000 SNX weekly entry and instead be replaced by a 10,000 SNX weekly entry directed to a wallet controlled by the Treasury Council.
