## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

This SIP proposes adding functionality that allows markets to increase their credit in the system by depositing collateral directly in the protocol.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the SIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the SIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

Markets will be able to deposit and withdraw accept collateral types, as permitted by SCCP. The value of this collateral will be effectively credited to their PnL. This decreases a marketâ€™s total balance of debt and increases the amount of withdrawable stablecoins for the market by the value of this collateral.

## Motivation

<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the SIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the SIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is inaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the SIP will address the issue!-->

For increased scalability, markets should be able issue debt in exchange for collateral 1:1 under specific circumstances. For example, this functionality will allow spot markets to implement wrappers (as in [SIP-182](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-182/)) and perpetual futures markets to implement a delta-neutral snxUSD issuer (as in [SIP-256](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-256/)).

## Technical Specification

<!--The specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature, there are five sections
1. Overview
2. Rationale
3. Technical Specification
4. Test Cases
5. Configurable Values
-->

### Overview

<!--This is a high level overview of *how* the SIP will solve the problem. The overview should clearly describe how the new feature will be implemented.-->

Implementation entails adding functions that markets may call to deposit and withdraw collateral, adding SCCP-configurable values to limit the amount of depositable collateral on a per-market basis, and updating the debt and credit calculations pertaining to markets accordingly.

### Rationale

<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs. The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

It is necessary to cap the amount of deposited collateral because, in an extreme circumstance, the amount of market-provided collateral could greatly exceed the amount of collateral deposited to stakers. Market-provided collateral cannot be liquidated, so in the case of a drastic deviation between collateral value and outstanding debt, the stablecoin's collateralization could be jeopardized.

### Technical Specification

<!--The technical specification should outline the public API of the changes proposed. That is, changes to any of the interfaces Synthetix currently exposes or the creations of new ones.-->

For implementation, we can add a `MarketCollateral` module. This will include a `depositMarketCollateral()` and `withdrawMarketCollateral()` function.

SCCPs will be able to configure a maximum amount of each collateral type per market with a `configureMaximumMarketCollateral()` function. This maximum should default to 0. `depositMarketCollateral()` should revert if the total amount of collateral provided by a given market exceeds this value.

The `_totalBalance` of a given market should be reduced by the value of the collateral that it has deposited. The `getWithdrawableUsd` value should increase by this amount.

### Test Cases

<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for SIPs but can be included with the implementation..-->

Relevant tests will be developed during implementation.

### Configurable Values (Via SCCP)

<!--Please list all values configurable via SCCP under this implementation.-->
