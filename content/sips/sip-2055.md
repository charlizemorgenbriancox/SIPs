## Simple Summary

The sip proposes to put in place a new dynamic gas fee module which replaces the one currently implemented under [SIP-2013](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-2013/). The new module would incorporate the necessary changes in transaction costs associated with optimism's [ecotone upgrade](https://docs.optimism.io/stack/transactions/fees#ecotone). Depending on governance, optimism is expected to update their gas pricing mechanism around the same time as ethereum rolls out [EIP-4844](https://www.eip4844.com/) at slot [296568](https://beaconcha.in/slot/8626176). Therefore, this sip would be implemented immediately following ecotone. It is important to mention that around a 3x decrease in gas costs is anticipated because of these changes.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the SIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the SIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

The dynamic gas fee module is a standard [Gnosis Safe Module](https://help.safe.global/en/articles/4934378-what-is-a-module) that is able to alter the `minKeeperFee` in our [`PerpsV2MarketSettings`](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x649F44CAC3276557D03223Dbf6395Af65b11c11c) within bounds specified in the contract and configurable via governance:
- The calculation steps of the minKeeperFee is as follows (detailed example below):
 1) `costOfExecutionGross := (l2GasPrice * l2GasUnits + l1GasPrice * l1GasUnits) * ETH/USD`
 2) `profitMargin := max(profitMarginUSD; costOfExecutionGross * profitMarginPercent )`
 3) `costOfExecutionNet := costOfExecutionGross + profitMargin`
 4) `minKeeperFee := min(costOfExecutionNet ; minKeeperFeeUpperBound)`
- The `ETH/USD` price is obtained with the on-chain chainlink ETH oracle
- The profit margin is incorporated in order to absorb shocks to gas prices on the one hand and to incentivize a decentralized keeper network
- The  upper bound on the `minKeeperFee` is incorporated for safety purposes
- The number of gas units required on L1 and L2 are configurable via SCCP
- Computation of `l2GasPrice`and `l1GasPrice` are detailed [here](#on-chain-gas-price-values)

## Motivation

The main motivation is to continue to incentivize the decentralized community keepers to execute perps v2 settlement & liquidation transactions by covering the cost of execution.

## Specification

The following functions would be incorporated into the new [DynamicGasFeeModule](https://github.com/Synthetixio/perps-dynamic-keeper-fees/pull/2):

### getMinKeeperFee:
This is a getter public function that returns computed gas price given on-chain variables

### setMinKeeperFee:
This is a publicly callable function that updates the `minKeeperFee` in PerpsV2MarketSettings

### getParameters:
This is a getter public function that returns the current configurations specified under the  Configurable Values section

### setParameters:
This can only be called by the owner, whereby the variables specified under the Configurable Values section, can be updated

### setPaused:
Allows to pause and unpause the gnosis module

### Owner
Returns the owner of the module that can pause the module


#### L1 and L2 Gas Price:
As per the [ecotone](https://docs.optimism.io/stack/transactions/fees#ecotone) specification, the L1 and L2 gas price are obtained as per the below:

`l1GasPrice = (baseFeeScalar * l1BaseFee * 16 + blobBaseFeeScalar * blobBaseFee) / (16 * 10 ** decimals)`

where the below variables are obtained by calling the functions on the optimism gas price precompile under `0x420000000000000000000000000000000000000F`:

- `baseFeeScalar` 
- `l1BaseFee`
- `blobBaseFeeScalar`
- `blobBaseFee` 
- `decimals`

`l2GasPrice` is obtained by simply calling `block.baseFee`

### Test Cases

#### Gas Price Module Configurations:
- `profitMarginPercent`: 20%
- `profitMarginUSD`: 1 sUSD
- `minKeeperFeeUpperBound`: 30 sUSD
- `gasUnitsL1` : 10,500 GAS
- `gasUnitsL2` : 1.35e6 GAS

#### On-chain Gas Price Values:
- `l1BaseFee` : 50 GWEI 
- `baseFeeScalar`: 7600
- `blobBaseFee`: 320 (40 GWEI * 16 scaling)
- `blobBaseFeeScalar`: 0.862e6
- `decimals`: 6
- `l2GasPrice`: 0.005 GWEI/GAS
- `ETH/USD`: 2500$

#### Min Keeper Fee Calculation:
- `l1GasPrice = (7600 * 50e9 * 16 + 320e9 * 0.862e6) / (16 * 10 ** 6) / 1e9 = 17.62 GWEI/GAS`
- `costOfExecutionGrossGwei = 17.62 GWEI/GAS * 10,500 GAS + 0.005 GWEI/GAS * 1.35e6 GAS = 191,760 GWEI`
- `costOfExecutionGrossUSD = (191,760/1e9) ETH * 2500 USD/ETH ~= 0.48 sUSD`
- `profitMargin = max(1 ; 20% * 0.48) = 1 sUSD`
- `costOfExecutionNet = 1+0.48 = 1.48 sUSD`
- `minKeeperFee = min(1.48;30) = 1.48 sUSD`

### Configurable Values (Via SCCP)

- `minKeeperFeeUpperBound` being the upper bound on the minKeeperFee that can be updated, (set to 30 sUSD)
- `gasUnitsL1` and `gasUnitsL2` being the number of gas units required to settle a offchain delayed order 
- `profitMarginUSD` being a profit margin in sUSD, applied on the cost of execution, (set to 1 sUSD)
- `profitMarginPercent` being a keeper profit margin in percentage, applied on the cost of execution, (set to 20%)
