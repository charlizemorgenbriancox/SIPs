## Simple Summary
Configure the Andromeda Base V3 deployment to accept USDC collateral, and enable ETH and BTC markets on Perps V3.

## Abstract
This SIP proposes to configure the Andromeda Base V3 deployment such that it accepts USDC collateral for both LP and perp margin. Additionally, ETH and BTC markets will be enabled on Perps V3. Focussing on USDC collateral limits the complexity of the deployment, reduces risk and increases alignment with the Base network. The complete Andromeda on Base release also requires [SIP-345](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-345/), [SIP-337](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-337) and [SIP-315](https://github.com/Synthetixio/SIPs/pull/1748).

## Motivation
Configuring Andromeda on Base to accept USDC for LPing and perp margin opens up Synthetix to a new set of users. The initial configuration should be conservative and leave room to expand as usage increases.

## Specification

### Overview
This SIP will define the Andromeda Base V3 deployment settings to accept USDC as collateral for LPing, and margin for trading Perps. It will also activate ETH and BTC markets on Perps V3 with conservative configurations. A USDC Spot Market and Wrapper will be implemented so that both LPs and perp traders only have to think about USDC, and utilizes the existing configrtuation capability of the underlying systems. This configuration treats USDC as a constant valued at $1. The spot market wrapper will be used to produce the 1:1 redeemable synth sUSDC for LPing, and swapping to sUSD for perp margin.

### Rationale
The introduction of USDC as collateral, with a constant value, provides an opportunity to test the market's appetite in a controlled manner before adding more complex assets like ETH. By using a spot market wrapper, a 1:1 redeemable synth sUSDC will facilitate Perps trading. The initial limitation to $5m of LP collateral, and the disabling of minting is a conscious decision to increase the liquidity available to the Perps Market.

### Technical Specification
Configure the core system:
Require Markets to have 125% collateralization, and require at least 1 days before being able to withdraw collateral
- `minimum_liquidity_ratio` = 125% 
- `account_timeout_withdraw` = 1 day

Enable USDC as collateral, at a fixed price of $1, and maximum of $5m
- `usdc_address` = 0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913
- `registerNode` = CONSTANT NODE, 1
- `synthUsdcMaxMarketCollateral` = 5000000

Disable minting, and set liquidation at 110%
- `issuanceRatioD18` = MaxUint256
- `liquidationRatioD18` = 1.10

Global Perps Market configuration
- `maxCollateralAmounts` = 1000000 ($1m maximum perp margin per account to be conservative)
- `synthDeductionPriority` = [0] (no liquidation priority required with only one margin type)
- `maxPositionsPerAccount` = 5 (max 5 positions per account to reduce gas.)
- `maxCollateralsPerAccount` = 1 (sUSD is the only perp margin enabled)

Configure ETH and BTC Perps Markets:
