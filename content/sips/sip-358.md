## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the SCCP.-->

This sip aims to enhancing the resilience of the v3 staking system, by introducing a multiplier applied on the minimum required credit capacity associated with a super market. This multiplier becomes active during periods when liquidation are in the process of being consumed via the rate limiter and reverts to `1` otherwise. The multiplier raises the minimum credit requirement on a given perp super market, preventing liquidity providers (LPs) from reducing their credit capacity until the liquidation process is completed.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the variable change proposed.-->

The `lockedOiMultiple` is a governance-configurable parameter, that default to `1` when there are no positions in a pending liquidation state. However, it dynamically switches to the configured value (e.g., 100x) when positions are in the process of being liquidated. This new parameter is implemented in the [requiredCredit](https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix-v3/blob/main/markets/perps-market/contracts/storage/PerpsMarket.sol#L423) function and can be configurable at the supermarket level.


## Motivation

<!--The motivation is critical for SCCPs that want to update variables within Synthetix. It should clearly explain why the existing variable is not incentive aligned. SCCP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->

Perps V3 innovation departed from the Perps V2 [endorsedLiquidator](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-2005/) approach for liquidation execution, opting instead for a rate-limiting system. This system distributes large liquidations, akin to the method employed by centralized exchanges in unwinding large positions via a time-weighted average price (TWAP). However, this strategy introduces the potential challenge faced whereby liquidity providers exit during periods of heightened price volatility to avoid potential losses on their staked assets.
To address this, the introduction of the `lockedOiMultiple`  restrict liquidity providers from being able to exit during times when liquidation are being rate limited.

## Specification

<!--The therefore specification should describe the syntax and semantics of new feature, there are five sections
1. Overview
2. Rationale
3. Technical Specification
4. Test Cases
5. Configurable Values
-->

The specification includes incorporating a new function `requiredCreditForUndelegation` shown below:
```
    function requiredCreditForUndelegation(uint128 marketId) internal view returns (uint) {
        return
            PerpsMarket.requiredCredit(marketId)
                       .mulDecimal(GlobalPerpsMarketConfiguration.lockedOiMultiple());
    }
```

Incorporating the below function to `GlobalPerpsMarketModule`: 

```
    function lockedOiMultiple() public view returns (uint256) {
        if (liquidationModule.flaggedAccounts.length > 0) {
            return lockedOiMultipleD3;
        } else {
            return 1;
        }
    }
```

Status update as per authors' request

### Test Cases

<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for SIPs but can be included with the implementation..-->

- Setting the `lockedOiMultiple` to `1,000`:
    - When liquidations are being rate limited
      - When a staker attempts to decrease his delegated liquidity
        - ❌ The transaction reverts due to the `minCreditCapacity` being artificially increased 
    - When  there are no pending liquidations in the queue
      - When a staker attempts to decrease his delegated liquidity
          - ✅ Then the transaction succeeds and the the lp's credit capacity associated with that perp supermarket is reduced 

### Configurable Values (Via SCCP)

<!--Please list all values configurable via SCCP under this implementation.-->
- `lockedOiMultipleD3` is a configurable value that becomes active when liquidations are being rate limited
