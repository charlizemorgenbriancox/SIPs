## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the SCCP.-->

Move the 6,000 SNX reward emission from current sUSD pool to Optimism metapool at `0x061b87122Ed14b9526A813209C8a59a633257bAb` by bribing Curve vote to vote on gauge `0xc5aE4B5F86332e70f3205a8151Ee9eD9F71e0797`


## Motivation

<!--The motivation is critical for SCCPs that want to update variables within Synthetix. It should clearly explain why the existing variable is not incentive aligned. SCCP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->

Curve sUSD pool has played a very big role in pegging sUSD since its existence. Currently, 6,000 SNX is minted per week as reward for depositing in the pool. After community consideration, this inflation will be used to incentivize L2 metapool now given that they make up a small proportion of the rewards on L1 and would make up a significant proportion of rewards on L2 and should be use to improve liquidity on L2 instead.
