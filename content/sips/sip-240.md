## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

Liquidates the correct amount of debt for accounts with mostly escrowed SNX

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the SIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the SIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "We propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

An account whose SNX collateral composition is predominantly in escrow will not have the proper amount of debt burned when it is liquidated.
The liquidated amount is currently based on the proportion of their SNX balance relative to all of their collateral (including escrow + liquidator rewards). This leads to burning less debt than expected, which effectively adds an unnecessary penalty.
This SIP ensures that the correct amount of debt is liquidated for accounts in this situation.

## Motivation

<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs? The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

To make sure that accounts with a majority of their collateral in escrow are not penalized more than intended when liquidated.

### Technical Specification

In the case that `totalRedeemed > transferableBalance`, the `amountToLiquidate` needs to take into the account the liquidation penalty.

Update L720 in `Issuer.liquidateAccount` to burn debt corresponding to the `penalty` instead of the proportion of an account's collateral. 

i.e. `Synthetix.balanceOf(addr) / _collateral(addr)`

```
/* Current code */
amountToLiquidate = debtBalance.multiplyDecimal(transferableBalance).divideDecimal(collateralForAccount);
```

```
/* Proposed code */
amountToLiquidate = transferableBalance.multiplyDecimal(SafeDecimalMath.unit().add(penalty));
```
