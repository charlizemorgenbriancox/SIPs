## Abstract

SIP-335 proposes a minor change to Synthetix V3's implementation of ERC20 that allows 0 value approvals, which is needed for token revokes. Currently, due to a check in `_checkZeroAddressOrAmount`, the lowest value that can be set is 1 and an `InvalidParameter` revert is thrown when 0 is passed.

## Motivation

By not reverting and allowing 0 value approvals, it means the ERC20 implementation allows for downstream services and users to fall inline with the recommendation defined in [EIP-20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20) to prevent certain attack vectors.

> To prevent attack vectors, clients SHOULD make sure to create user interfaces in such a way that they set the allowance first to 0 before setting it to another value for the same spender. THOUGH The contract itself shouldnâ€™t enforce it, to allow backwards compatibility with contracts deployed before

## Specification

Implementation entails a slight modification to `_approve(address owner, address spender, uint256 amount)` (which calls `_checkZeroAddressOrAmount`) to only check for zero address. However, given that `_checkZeroAddressOrAmount` is also used in `_mint(address to, uint256 amount)` and `_transfer(address from, address to, uint256 amount)`, to preserve this functionality, it is necessary to add a `_checkZeroAddress` specifically for `_approve`.
