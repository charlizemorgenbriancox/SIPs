<!--You can leave these HTML comments in your merged SIP and delete the visible duplicate text guides, they will not appear and may be helpful to refer to if you edit it again. This is the suggested template for new SIPs. Note that an SIP number will be assigned by an editor. When opening a pull request to submit your SIP, please use an abbreviated title in the filename, `sip-draft_title_abbrev.md`. The title should be 44 characters or less.-->

## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

This SIP proposes a modification to the current `Exchanger` implementation to prevent breaking changes from the Alsephina release.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the SIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the SIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

The `Exchanger.feeRateForExchange` function signature changed in the Alsephina release. This SIP proposes that the old function signature remains the same to prevent integrations that rely on the function from breaking.

## Motivation

<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the SIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the SIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is innaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the SIP will address the issue!-->

This function signature change has broken some integrations with key Synthetix ecosystem partners. We should re-include the older function signature in order to remedy the situation.

## Specification

<!--The specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature, there are five sections
1. Overview
2. Rationale
3. Technical Specification
4. Test Cases
5. Configurable Values
-->

### Overview

<!--This is a high level overview of *how* the SIP will solve the problem. The overview should clearly describe how the new feature will be implemented.-->

This SIP will revert back to the previous function signature:
`function feeRateForExchange(bytes32 sourceCurrencyKey, bytes32 destinationCurrencyKey) external view returns (uint);`

### Rationale

<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs. The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

We can revert back to the previous function signature by first checking `tooVolatile` in the `feeRateForExchange` function and then simply return the `feeRate`.

### Technical Specification

<!--The technical specification should outline the public API of the changes proposed. That is, changes to any of the interfaces Synthetix currently exposes or the creations of new ones.-->

In `Exchanger`:

```
    function feeRateForExchange(bytes32 sourceCurrencyKey, bytes32 destinationCurrencyKey) external view returns (uint) {
        (uint feeRate, bool tooVolatile) = _feeRateForExchange(sourceCurrencyKey, destinationCurrencyKey);
        require(!tooVolatile, "too volatile to trade");
        return feeRate;
    }
```

This SIP has no implications for the public interface of Synthetix.

### Test Cases

<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for SIPs but can be included with the implementation..-->

A unit test has been added to the relevant pull request for this SIP.

### Configurable Values (Via SCCP)

<!--Please list all values configurable via SCCP under this implementation.-->
