## Simple Summary

Create a DYDXPERP market on Optimism 

## Abstract

This is a proposal to offer a DYDXPERP futures which tracks the price of the $DYDX token

## Motivation

$DYDX is the native token of a decentralized perpetual exchange which offers trading markets in a variety of assets. The $DYDX token is emitted to traders and market makers on dYdX Exchange (dYdX Trading inc.) once per epoch (every 28 days) and is currently not available for trade on any DeFi derivative market. Synthetix has an opportunity to capture a lot of volume and fees from users looking to hedge their $DYDX exposure before the end of every Epoch.

### Rationale

The majority of demand for DYDXPERP, will likely come from dYdX Exchange users who have earned a significant amount of $DYDX and will be looking to hedge their gains in the 1 week waiting period at the end of every trading Epoch on the dYdX Exchange. This presents an interesting opportunity for Synthetix to attract users of a competing DeFi Perpetual exchange and on board them to Synthetix and Optimism. The majority of these traders wouldn't ever come and trade Synthetix Perpetuals otherwise, since they're being heavily subsidized for trading on dYdX Exchange. Although $DYDX isn't an overly popular or in-demand token, this is a golden opportunity to onboard some of their users and synthetix should seize it by offering a DYDXPERP market.
