<!--You can leave these HTML comments in your merged SIP and delete the visible duplicate text guides, they will not appear and may be helpful to refer to if you edit it again. This is the suggested template for new SIPs. Note that an SIP number will be assigned by an editor. When opening a pull request to submit your SIP, please use an abbreviated title in the filename, `sip-draft_title_abbrev.md`. The title should be 44 characters or less.-->

## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

This SIP proposes adding functionality such that pools may require two function calls from liquidity providers to reduce their amount of collateral delegated to a pool: one to request reducing their collateral to a specified amount and another (after a configurable delay) to process the change.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the SIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the SIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

Pool owners will be able to set an `undelegateDelay` and `undelegateDelayWindow`. If `undelegateDelay` is set to a non-zero value, liquidity providers call `requestDelegateCollateral` when reducing their amount of delegated collateral. This stores the request along with the current timestamp. This change is then finalized with a call to `processDelegateCollateral` after more than the `undelegateDelay` has passed and less than `undelegateDelay + undelegateDelayWindow` has passed.

## Motivation

<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the SIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the SIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is inaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the SIP will address the issue!-->

This functionality allows pool owners to prevent adversial dynamics between liquidity providers. For example, if a liquidity provider is able to anticipate a large increase of debt to a pool—without this feature enabled—they could quickly exit the pool such that other liquidity providers assume the change and subsequently re-enter.

Note that this functionality would be implemented in addition to the Minimum Collateral Delegation Duration (per [SIP-320](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-320/)) and the Core System Precautionary Security Features (per [SIP-316](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-316/)).

## Rationale

<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs. The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

It would be possible to have governance configure this value globally—rather than having pool owners decide on the configuration—but this would complicate liquidity provisioning for all integrators, as this makes delegation non-atomic. Further, because this is meant to reduce adversial liquidity provisioning and does not pose a broader risk to the core system, it is appropriate to have it defined at the pool-level.

### Technical Specification

<!--The technical specification should outline the public API of the changes proposed. That is, changes to any of the interfaces Synthetix currently exposes or the creations of new ones.-->

* `unit256 undelegateDelay` and `uint256 undelegateDelayWindow` should be added to the `PoolCollateralConfiguration` storage library.
* Appropriate getter and setter methods should be added to the `PoolConfigurationModule`.
* `requestDelegateCollateral(uint128 accountId,uint128 poolId,address collateralType,uint256 newCollateralAmountD18,uint256 leverage)` should be added to the `VaultModule`. This should perform similar checks as `delegateCollateral`, but store the request (along with the `block.timestamp`) to a mapping in the `Vault` storage library.
* `processDelegateCollateral(uint128 accountId,uint128 poolId,address collateralType)` functions should be added to the `VaultModule`. This should confirm that the collateralization ratio of the position will not drop below the issuance ratio if the delegation change is processed. It can be called permissionlessly, such that anyone can process an open request. It should confirm that a corresponding request exists in storage, that the stored timestamp is greater than the `block.timestamp + undelegateDelay` has passed, and less than `undelegateDelay + undelegateDelayWindow` has passed.
* `delegateCollateral` can call `requestDelegateCollateral` or `processDelegateCollateral` as appropriate if collateral is being reduced and `undelegationDelay` is set.

### Test Cases

<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for SIPs but can be included with the implementation..-->

Relevant tests will be developed during implementation.

### Configurable Values (Via SCCP)

<!--Please list all values configurable via SCCP under this implementation.-->

* `unit256 undelegateDelay` per pool, as defined above.
* `uint256 undelegateDelayWindow` per pool, as defined above.
