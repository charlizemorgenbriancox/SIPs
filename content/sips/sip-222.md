## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

Update exchange fees to be charged as a sum of fees for source and destination synths.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the SIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the SIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

This SIP proposes to modify the current exchange fee system to compound source and destination synth fees rather than simply charging the rate associated with the destination synth. 

## Motivation

<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the SIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the SIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is inaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the SIP will address the issue!-->

In the current exchange fee system, a specific exchange fee is attached to each synth and the fee charged for an exchange is determined by the destination synth’s fee. While this is sufficient for exchanges into and out of sUSD (or other fiat synths), it is less suitable for exchanges between volatile assets. Exchange fees and oracle deviation thresholds are largely calibrated to the price action for the USD pair. Thus, exchanges between volatile assets are more likely to be frontrunnable. Furthermore, the current system also imposes an overly punitive fee between stable asset synths (fiat synths) due to the potential for frontrunning by trading into them from a more volatile asset. An indirect benefit of the system proposed here is that fees for exchanges between stable asset synths can be lowered significantly. 

## Specification

<!--The specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature, there are five sections
1. Overview
2. Rationale
3. Technical Specification
4. Test Cases
5. Configurable Values
-->

### Overview

<!--This is a high level overview of *how* the SIP will solve the problem. The overview should clearly describe how the new feature will be implemented.-->

Currently the fee for an exchange is a function of the destination synth’s associated fee. This SIP proposes that instead, the fee charged be set to the sum of fees for both synths. 

### Rationale

<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs. The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

Setting exchange fees as a sum of fees between the source and destination synths helps better align fees with the cost/risk of provisioning liquidity for a pair of assets. For instance, if fees for all synths are set to 30bp, the fee for e.g. sUSD <> sAAVE and sUNI <> sAAVE are identical, though the latter carries significantly more frontrunning risk. Additionally, the fee for sUSD <> sEUR must also be set to 30bp, which is overly punitive given that EUR:USD is extremely stable. 

### Technical Specification

<!--The technical specification should outline the public API of the changes proposed. That is, changes to any of the interfaces Synthetix currently exposes or the creations of new ones.-->

Proposed exchange fees
Ethereum L1:
- sUSD = 0 bp
- All forex synths = 15 bp
- sBTC, sETH = 25 bp
- sLINK = 85 bp
- sADA, sDOT, sAAVE, sDEFI = 100 bp

Optimsim L2:
- sUSD = 0 bp
- All forex synths = 15 bp
- sETH, sBTC = 25 bp
- sLINK = 30 bp
- sSOL, sMATIC, sAVAX, sAAVE, sUNI = 35 bp

### Test Cases

<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for SIPs but can be included with the implementation..-->

Fees for [sUSD, sEUR, sETH, sAAVE] = [0 bp, 15 bp, 25 bp, 100 bp]
- sUSD <> sETH fee = 25 bp
- sETH <> sAAVE fee = 125 bp
- sEUR <> sUSD fee = 15 bp
- sETH <> sEUR fee = 40 bp

### Configurable Values (Via SCCP)

<!--Please list all values configurable via SCCP under this implementation.-->
