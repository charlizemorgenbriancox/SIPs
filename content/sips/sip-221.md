### Simple Summary

Equal c-ratios per network after debt synthesis.

### Overview

The SIP aims to evening out the c-ratios for SNX stakers across both networks post debt synthesis. 

### Motivation

Currently the c-ratio for SNX stakers on L1 is 400% while the c-ratio for SNX stakers on L2 is 500%. After debt synthesis the debt pools of L1 and L2 effectively become one. The c-ratio percentage should be equal for all stakers in fairness; so that minters can mint the same amount of synths independent of the network where SNX is staked. 

### Rationale

To even the playing field for all SNX stakers after debt synthesis independent of the network where they are staking SNX.   

### Specification

C-ratio on L1 = 400%
C-ratio on L2 = 400%
