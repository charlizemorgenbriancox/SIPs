## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

This SIP proposes adding Fixed Forex contracts to the Direct Integration Manager.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the SIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the SIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

As outlined in [SIP-267](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-267/), every new Direct Integration needs to be specified in a sip along with the parameters proposed for that integration. Therefore this sip proposes to allow the Fixed Forex contracts to trade at the overridden parameters.
Two integrations have been requested by the fixed forex team:

A) Convex Farming use case:
  1) User deposits WETH, DAI, USDT or USDC
  2) WETH or the stable of choice is swapped to sUSD on Curve
  3) sUSD is swapped to sEUR or sGBP or sJPY or sCHF or sAUD or sKRW with atomic swaps
  4) sEUR or sGBP or sJPY or sCHF or sAUD or sKRW  is deposited into a Curve pool that holds ib Tokens
  5) the Curve LP is deposited into Convex

B) Forex Trading use case:
  1) User can swap any forex stable synth to any other forex stable synth
