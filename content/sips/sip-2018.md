## Simple Summary
Add pDAO es 5th signer to Treasury Council Addresses

## Abstract
The Treasury Council’s addresses current signer threshold is ¾. This proposal suggests that pDAO is added as a 5th signer in order to reduce key-loss risk that could result in lost funds

## Motivation
The current signer threshold for Treasury Council addresses is ¾. This is a risky setup given that if two signers lose their keys or have them compromised, the funds that are used to continue building the protocol could get lost forever. This SIP aims to add the pDAO, a neutral party, as a 5th signer to ameliorate the risk of losing TC funds. 

## Specification
The proposal suggests that the treasury council adds the pDAO (0x432b5fd638513bfdb6b4e5c6cc4274cb45d79bd7) as a 5th signer and changes the threshold to ⅗ for the following addresses:

- TC  L1 Main 0x99F4176EE457afedFfCB1839c7aB7A030a5e4A92
- TC OP Main 0x9644A6920bd0a1923C2C6C1DddF691b7a42e8A65 
- Unstaked SNX 0x5190Fc91C0a36dCEEc23c9344d131E5E3177A3FC
