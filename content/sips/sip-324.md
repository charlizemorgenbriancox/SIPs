<!--You can leave these HTML comments in your merged SIP and delete the visible duplicate text guides, they will not appear and may be helpful to refer to if you edit it again. This is the suggested template for new SIPs. Note that an SIP number will be assigned by an editor.

## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

This SIP proposes a v3 pool for passive snx staking, that does not have market exposure, with yield provided by an external source. Treasury Council has expressed interest in funding such a pool through [STP-4](https://sips.synthetix.io/stps/stp-4/), and would control the yield. 

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the SIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the SIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

Create a new v3 pool, market and rewards distributor contract. Register the market and rewards distributor, and set the minimum delegation (staking) time to 3 months.

## Motivation

<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the SIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the SIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is inaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the SIP will address the issue!-->

Approx 30% of snx (95m) is not staked, with at least 20m snx held on centralized exchanges. Passive snx holders are either unable or unwilling to actively stake and manage debt. Passive snx staking could attract some of the unstaked snx, and be a stepping stone to active staking and contributing to network collateral.

## Specification

<!--The specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature, there are five sections
1. Overview
2. Rationale
3. Technical Specification
4. Test Cases
5. Configurable Values
-->

### Overview

<!--This is a high level overview of *how* the SIP will solve the problem. The overview should clearly describe how the new feature will be implemented.-->

This SIP proposes to create a v3 pool for passive snx staking, for holders who don’t want market exposure, in a way that centralized exchanges can offer to their customers. The proposed staking pool makes use of the v3 pool, market and rewards distributor capabilities.

### Rationale

<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs. The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

SNX holders who don’t have the desire or ability to manage the debt of an active staking position are passive speculators that could be encouraged to contribute to the network collateral. Passive staking is insulated from the risk as well as the rewards of market exposure, so the yield would need to come from an external source such as the Treasury Council. As an example TC could provide 80k snx per month, giving 10m staked snx a yield of 9.6%, and require a 3 month staking lockup.

### Technical Specification

<!--The technical specification should outline the public API of the changes proposed. That is, changes to any of the interfaces Synthetix currently exposes or the creations of new ones.-->

1. *createPool* create a new v3 Pool called “Passive SNX Pool”
2. *registerMarket* nullMarket with no exposure
3. *setMarketMinDelegateTime* on nullMarket to 7,776,000 seconds so that *minDelgateTime* on Passive SNX Pool is 3 months
4. set Pool debt issuance to zero - depends on [SIP-326](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-326/)
6. Create rewardsDistributor contract
7. *registerRewardsDistributor* 

TC will then be able to direct snx to the *rewardsDistributor* contract.

### Test Cases

<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for SIPs but can be included with the implementation..-->

N/A

### Configurable Values (Via SCCP)

<!--Please list all values configurable via SCCP under this implementation.-->

_minDelegateTime_ of the Passive SNX Pool
