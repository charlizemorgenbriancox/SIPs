## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

Adds a new system setting for SNX staker liquidations

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the SIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the SIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "We propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

Currently, there exists only one liquidation penalty variable, `liquidationPenalty`, which is used for both Collateral loans and SNX staking. This is less than ideal since each liquidation type has a unique impact on the debt pool. It also reduces flexibility when trying to set different penalties for each type of liquidation via SCCP.
This SIP proposes to add another liquidation penalty variable, `snxLiquidationPenalty`, in order to distinguish between liquidations on Collateral loans and SNX stakers.

## Motivation

<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs? The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

To make sure the proper liquidation penalties are applied to both loans and stakers. 

### Technical Specification

This SIP requires the following:
 
- Create a new variable in System Settings, `snxLiquidationPenalty`, which is initially set to `30%` for SNX liquidations
- Update the `Liquidator` contract so that all references to `liquidationPenalty` are replaced with `snxLiquidationPenalty`
- Set `liquidationPenalty` to `10%` for Collateral loan liquidations

### Test Cases

- Check that a 10% penalty is levied when liquidating Collateral loans
- Check that a 30% penalty is levied when liquidating SNX stakers
- Consider extreme cases
  - e.g. stakers having only escrowed SNX, not enough balanceOf to reach the issuance ratio, etc.

### Configurable Values (Via SCCP)

```
LIQUIDATION_PENALTY: w3utils.toWei('0.1'), // 10% penalty (used for Collateral loans)

SNX_LIQUIDATION_PENALTY: w3utils.toWei('0.3'), // 30% penalty (used for SNX staking)
```
