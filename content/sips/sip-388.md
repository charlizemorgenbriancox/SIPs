## Simple Summary

This SIP proposes the addition of EtherFi weETH tokens as LP collateral on Arbitrum V3 deployment.

## Abstract

In order to enhance the diversity of yield-generation and exposure options for LP collateral within the Synthetix ecosystem, this SIP aims to add EtherFi weETH tokens as LP collateral on Arbitrum V3 deployment. Depositors of weETH will continue to earn EtherFi points along with the native restaking yield of each token.

## Motivation

The addition of these yield tokens aims to:
- Increase the variety of yield-generating assets available to LP.
- Attract holders of weETH to the Synthetix ecosystem.
- Enhance the overall liquidity of Arbitrum V3 LP.

### Technical Specification

Implementation of this SIP will be contingent on the availability of an weETH price oracle on Arbitrum.

### Test Cases

N/A

### Configurable Values

Each LP parameter (LP cap, minimum minting c-ratio, liquidation ratio) will be configured via SCCP.
