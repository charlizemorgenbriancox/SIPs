## Simple Summary
<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->
Deprecate the `sINR` synth on optimism as described in [SIP-174](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-174/).

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the SIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the SIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

Deprecate these synths and allow for synth holder to redeem them into sUSD by `SynthRedeemer`. It is worth mentioning that there is only sUSD 140 worth of `sINR` outstanding.


## Motivation

<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the SIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the SIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is inaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the SIP will address the issue!-->

Given the low volume generated by those synths, as well as the attack surface, due to them having an open-ended open interest on the derivative, these synths are recommended to be deprecated with the owners being able to redeem them to sUSD.
