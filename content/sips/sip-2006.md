<!--You can leave these HTML comments in your merged SIP and delete the visible duplicate text guides, they will not appear and may be helpful to refer to if you edit it again. This is the suggested template for new SIPs. Note that an SIP number will be assigned by an editor. When opening a pull request to submit your SIP, please use an abbreviated title in the filename, `sip-draft_title_abbrev.md`. The title should be 44 characters or less.-->

## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

This SIP proposes adding exchange done by the Lyra protocol to the Direct Integration Manager, which lowers the exchange fee to 10 bp (on sETH and sBTC) and disables dynamic fees.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the SIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the SIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

As outlined in [SIP-267](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-267/), every new Direct Integration needs to be specified in a sip along with the parameters proposed for that integration. Therefore this sip proposes to allow the lyra contract to trade at the overridden parameters with lower fees and without any dynamic fees imposed. 


## Specification

The following parameters would be specified on the lyra exchange contract `0xbfa31380ED380cEb325153eA08f296A45A489108`:

```
{'currencyKey': 'sUSD',
 'exchangeFeeRate': 0,
 'exchangeDynamicFeeRounds':1,
 'exchangeMaxDynamicFee':10%}

{'currencyKey': 'sETH',
 'exchangeFeeRate': 10 bp,
 'exchangeDynamicFeeRounds':1,
 'exchangeMaxDynamicFee':10%}

{'currencyKey': 'sBTC',
 'exchangeFeeRate': 10 bp,
 'exchangeDynamicFeeRounds':1,
 'exchangeMaxDynamicFee':10%}

```
