## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

This SIP introduces one of the first components of the V3 Governance Module - called the Election Module. The Election Module is proposed to replace the existing [Snapshot](https://docs.snapshot.org/) election process carried out by the Synthetix DAOs whilst also providing a standard module which other protocols can use for their governance system.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the SIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the SIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "We propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

If this meta-governance proposal is approved, the Election Module will replace the off-chain elections carried out on Snapshot (i.e example [election space](https://snapshot.org/#/spartancouncil.eth)) - by deploying, on Optimism, a modular on-chain solution which will be configured to the existing governance election standards of Synthetix.

## Motivation

<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the SIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the SIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is inaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the SIP will address the issue!-->

Since the introduction of [SIP-93 - Delegated Council Governance](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-93/) which mainly introduced the Spartan Council the Synthetix Governance has evolved.

In the Synthetix Governance System - there are currently 5 official bodies

- Spartan Council
- Ambassador Council
- Grants Council
- Treasury Council
- Core Contributor Committee

In the journey to this current stage - the Synthetix Governance system has relied heavily on using apps that are still constantly improving (i.e Snapshot, Synthetix Staking dApp).

As the protocol governance grew, the protocol started out-growing existing processes, identifying the need to start building a system surrounding the current and future plans of Synthetix Governance - leading to the catalyst behind the V3GM (V3 Governance Module) product squad within the Core Contributors.

One of the first things that the protocol needed to solve was removing the centralized aspect of the governing body elections - the Election Module was built to replicate most of the election process that happens on snapshot into an modular and customizable on-chain solution.
More specifically - the election module addresses:

- Centralization of election strategy updating (both on snapshot team and synthetix ccâ€™s)
- Dependency on Core Contributors collecting nominations on Discord
- Dependency on Core Contributor/pDAO in transferring the Council/Committee NFTs on the conclusion of an election
- Standardize elections within the Web 3.0 space so other projects can replicate delegated governance

## Specification

<!--The specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature, there are five sections
1. Overview
2. Rationale
3. Technical Specification
4. Test Cases
5. Configurable Values
-->

### Overview

<!--This is a high-level overview of *how* the SIP will solve the problem. The overview should clearly describe how the new feature will be implemented-->

The Election Module is a factory set of smart contracts that given parameters relating to the delegated group it represents (i.e seat number, epoch length) will enable the necessary election processes to occur on-chain in a modular and decentralized way.

### Rationale

<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs? The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

TBD

### Technical Specification

TBD

### Test Cases

1. Standard Election
2. Standard Dismissal
3. Emergency Election

### Configurable Values (Via SCCP)

<!--Please list all values configurable via SCCP under this implementation.-->

- memberToken
- electionToken
- nextSeatCount
- nextEpochDuration
- nextEpochNominationPeriod
- nextEpochVotingPeriod
- nextEpochEvaluationPeriod
- dismissalThreshold
- minimumSeatCountThreshold
- emergencyElectionDuration
- maxProcessingBatchSize
