## Abstract

List the following assets on Perps V2 that are already listed on DYDX: RUNE, SUSHI, ZEC, XTZ, UMA, ENJ, ICP, XLM, 1INCH, EOS, CELO, ALGO, ZRX.

## Specification

### Rationale

Assets have demonstrated demand and activity through DYDX and provide an execution venue for arbitrage opportunities, helping to keep the markets delta neutral and generating demand from arbitrage traders.
