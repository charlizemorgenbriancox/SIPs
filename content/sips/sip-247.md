## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

This SIP proposes to create a wETH wrappr, with the wrappr factory with the following parameters:
 - mintFeeRate of 5 bp
 - burnFeeRate of 5 bp
 - maxTokenAmount of 5k ETH

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the SIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the SIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "We propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

- The `mintFeeRate` is the rate paid by those who wrap the underlying to issue the synth equivalent.
- The `burnFeeRate` is the rate paid by those who unwrap the underlying by burning the equivalent synth.
- The `maxTokenAmount` is max amount of synth that can be minted by the wrappr.


## Motivation

<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs? The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

The debt pool is long skewed  11k ETH ($20m) and  1,000 BTC ($29m), the increase in the wrappr cap will not result in negative skeweness, even if all the additional capacity is sent to stables.
A new wrappr with the factory is proposed to be initialized, as to transition to the new contracts that provides more flexibility by allowing an unwind with a negative `burnFeeRate`. 
Lastly, the new atomic exchange function would be rendered more useful with some wrappr capacity, as traders who would want to trader ETH to USDC would be able to mint `sETH` with ETH.

### Technical Specification

This SIP requires calling the `createWrapper` the [WrapperFactory](https://etherscan.io/address/0x02f9bC46beD33acdB9cb002fe346734CeF8a9480#writeContract) with the following parameters:
- `token`: `0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2`
- `currencyKey`: `sETH`
- `synthContractByName`: `ProxysETH` 

Then updating the parameters of the wrappr under the `SystemSettings` contract.

### Configurable Values (Via SCCP)

- `mintFeeRate`
- `burnFeeRate`
- `maxTokenAmount`
