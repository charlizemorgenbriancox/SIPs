## Abstract

SIP-342 Proposes adding a few missing view functions to read current state to be used in UI, tests and other scripts:

- `getAvailableRewards` to be added to the `RewardsManagerModule` to return an account balance for a registered distributor. 
- `getPoolCollateralConfiguration` to be added to the `PoolModule` to return a collateral configuration specific to the pool. 


## Motivation

Currently, to retrieve the available balance of an account a static call to `claimRewards` is required, which throws an exception on an account have a zero balance. This is cumbersome for frontend providers to handle an the exceptions must be handled.

Collateral configuration for pool is currently only available via event `PoolCollateralConfiguration` which makes it impossible to query contract directly to retrieve such configuration after it has been set. This requies UIs to rely on subgraphs exclusively to access such configuration.


### Technical Specification

In the `RewardsManagerModule` view function to be added:
```solidity
    function getAvailableRewards(
        uint128 accountId, 
        uint128 poolId, 
        address collateralType, 
        address distributor
    ) external view returns (uint256 rewardAmount);
```

In the `PoolModule` view function to be added:
```solidity
    function getPoolCollateralConfiguration(
        uint128 poolId,
        address collateralType
    ) external view returns (PoolCollateralConfiguration.Data memory config);
```

## Test Case

Extra test cases to be added for new view methods:
- `getAvailableRewards` in `RewardsManagerModule.test.ts`
- `getPoolCollateralConfiguration` in `PoolConfigurationModule.test.ts`
