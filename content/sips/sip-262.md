## Simple Summary

Create a XMR-PERP and DOGE-PERP markets on Optimism.

## Abstract

This is a proposal to offer XMR-PERP and DOGE-PERP futures which track the price of the $XMR and $DOGE cryptocurrency.

## Motivation

$XMR is the most established privacy centric cryptocurrency with the highest volume and deepest liquidity. In addition to being considered a blue chip offering available on most major centralized exchanges, Monero consistently shows lower correlation to changes in the BTC price than other top crypto assets.

$DOGE is a well established cryptocurrency that enjoys wide popularity with retail traders. Among the popular meme currencies, $DOGE is the most appropriate choice since it has the highest volume and deepest liquidity.

### Rationale

Monero has a strong and loyal community that shares the decentralized and permissionless ethos of Synthetix and ecosystem partners. Despite its popularity, Monero is also unavailable for trading in many jurisdictions, and many traders are unlikely to have an alternative venue. 

Because of these factors, Monero is likely to have a large base of holders who cannot, or do not wish to trade their spot positions. If Synthetix began offering $XMR futures, it would be the only decentralized offering of its kind, and could be valuable to $XMR holders with no alternative for hedging. Aside from its practicality, this would create a marketing opportunity for the Synthetix ecosystem to highlight its ethos and unique value proposition to outside communities.

Monero’s low correlation compared with other top crypto assets also makes the asset a useful offering for traders by offering trading opportunities under a wider variety of market conditions.

$DOGE is currently unavailable through competitors such as Perpetual Protocol and GMX, and its inclusion into Synthetix and Kwenta’s offerings would help display the breadth of possible assets.

Additionally, there is interest in the Kwenta community for this listing, as demonstrated by $DOGE having multiple direct requests from the community and placing in the top 3 in a recent community poll.

### Technical Specification

Implementation requires requesting price feeds from Chainlink, and should be dependent on Chainlink adding price feeds for both XMR and DOGE within an expiry window of 21 days from the passage of this proposal. 

If a price feed does not exist within the expiry window of 21 days, implementation should be halted unless council extends the expiry window via SCCP. 

### Test Cases

n/a

### Configurable Values (Via SCCP)

Open interest caps, fee tier, and expiry window.
