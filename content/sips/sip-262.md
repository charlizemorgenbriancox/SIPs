## Simple Summary

Create a XMR-PERP and DOGE-PERP markets on Optimism.

## Abstract

This is a proposal to offer XMR-PERP and DOGE-PERP futures which track the price of the $XMR and $DOGE cryptocurrency.

## Motivation

$XMR and $DOGE are well established cryptocurrencies with the deepest liquidity among assets in their particualar niche, and will add a varied selection of unique offerings for Synthetic Futures traders. $XMR is the most established privacy coin and $DOGE is the most established meme coin.

### Rationale

$XMR has a strong and loyal community that shares the decentralized and permissionless ethos of Synthetix and ecosystem partners. Despite its popularity, $XMR is also unavailable for trading in many jurisdictions, and many traders are unlikely to have an alternative venue. Because of these factors, Monero is likely to have a large base of holders who cannot, or do not wish to trade their spot positions. If Synthetix began offering $XMR futures, it would be the only decentralized offering of its kind, and could be valuable to $XMR holders with no alternative for hedging. Aside from its practicality, this would create a marketing opportunity for the Synthetix ecosystem to highlight its ethos and unique value proposition to outside communities.

$DOGE is currently unavailable through competitors such as Perpetual Protocol and GMX, and its inclusion into Synthetix and Kwentaâ€™s offerings would help display the breadth of possible assets. Additionally, there is interest in the Kwenta community for this listing, as demonstrated by $DOGE having multiple direct requests from the community and placing in the top 3 in a recent community poll.

### Technical Specification

Implementation requires requesting price feeds from Chainlink, and should be dependent on Chainlink adding price feeds for $XMR and $DOGE within an expiry window of 21 days from the passage of this proposal. 

If a suitable price feed does not exist within the expiry window of 21 days, implementation should be halted until the SIP is resubmitted for a vote, and passes successfully.
