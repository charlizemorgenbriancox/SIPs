## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

Create a Curve Futures market on Optimism 

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the SIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the SIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "We propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

This is a proposal to offer a Curve futures which tracks the price of the $Crv token

## Motivation


<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs? The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

$CRV is the token that powers the curve eco-system, where users can lock their curve tokens to be able to vote on gauges and partake in future curve inflation. The majority of demand for Curve perpertual market, will likely come from veCRV holders who are looking to hedge their locked position at an acceptable funding rate.
