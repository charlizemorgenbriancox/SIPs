## Summary
Pay DAOs' monthly stipend from inflation instead of from the Treasury Council's assets.

## Motivation

The motivation behind this SIP is to increase self-sufficiency for the DAO in terms of operating costs and to better align stake holders. 

The Treasury Council currently handles the 47,000 SNX p.month DAO stipends, which unnecessarily gives the TC an additional lever of influence over other Councils and reduces protocol autonomy.  

## Overview
Council members receive a monthly stipend for their participation. Currently, the process is done manually by the Treasury Council, which pays a predetermined amount to each council member. Current total monthly stipends amount 47,000 SNX.

 This SIP proposes that 47,000 SNX of monthly inflation is diverted to the addresses holding their respective Council NFT, and paid weekly in order to accommodate existing weekly inflation minting. 

Additionally, this SIP proposes that monthly stipend amounts become configurable via SCCP moving forward. 

## Specification

The implementation requires pDAO to call `4. addRewardDistribution` on the [Synthetix: Rewards Distribution contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x29C295B046a73Cde593f21f63091B072d407e3F2#writeContract#F4), passing an address with a specific reward per week.

In order to stop payments at the end of an epoch, pDAO needs to call `7. removeRewardDistribution` to stop transferring SNX to former council members.
