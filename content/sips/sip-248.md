## Simple Summary

Create a DOGE-PERP market on Optimism.

## Abstract

This is a proposal to offer DOGE-PERP futures which track the price of the $DOGE cryptocurrency.

## Motivation

$DOGE is a well established cryptocurrency that enjoys wide popularity with retail traders. Among the popular meme currencies, $DOGE is the most appropriate choice since it has the highest volume and deepest liquidity.

### Rationale

To showcase the benefits of integrating with Synthetix, it is important to list assets which may not be available on other decentralized futures trading platforms. $DOGE is currently unavailable through competitors such as Perpetual Protocol and GMX, and its inclusion into Synthetix and Kwentaâ€™s offerings would help display the breadth of possible assets.

Additionally, there is interest in the Kwenta community for this listing, as demonstrated by $DOGE having multiple direct requests from the community and placing in the top 3 in a recent community poll.

### Technical Specification

Needs a Chainlink price feed on Optimism.

### Test Cases

n/a

### Configurable Values (Via SCCP)

Open interest caps and fee tier
