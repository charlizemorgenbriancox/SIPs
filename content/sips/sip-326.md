## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

This SIP introduces enhanced configurability for v3 pools by enabling pool owners to deactivate specific collateral types or define a more conservative collateralization ratio.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the SIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the SIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

This proposal advocates the creation of a new mapping, under the pool owner's control, which could either disable certain collateral types or establish a more stringent collateralization ratio. The suggested override would only permit a more cautious configuration than the system configuration determined by governance.

## Motivation

<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the SIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the SIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is inaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the SIP will address the issue!-->


All pools currently inherit the system-wide configurations of permitted collateral types and collateralization ratio. For pools to be able to become more specialized, per-pool configuration is required. [SIP-324](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-324/) is an example of a pool that would require non-snx collateral to be disabled, and borrowing disabled.

## Specification

<!--The specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature, there are five sections
1. Overview
2. Rationale
3. Technical Specification
4. Test Cases
5. Configurable Values
-->

### Overview

<!--This is a high level overview of *how* the SIP will solve the problem. The overview should clearly describe how the new feature will be implemented.-->

This SIP recommends implementing a mapping of adjustable overrides by the pool owner for: 
1. collateral type: only collateral types permitted by the system can be disabled on the pool, and no additional collateral types can be enabled.
2. collateralization ratio: the system will utilize the higher value between the override and the global ratio, as set by governance.

The mappings only permit **more** **conservative** configuration than the system configuration.

### Rationale

<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs. The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

The aim is to provide pool owners with the option to adopt a more conservative stance than the governance-established system configuration. By disabling collateral types, the pool owner can limit the scope of collateral accepted by the pool. By limiting or disabling the minting of debt, pool owners can limit or prevent market exposure.

### Technical Specification

<!--The technical specification should outline the public API of the changes proposed. That is, changes to any of the interfaces Synthetix currently exposes or the creations of new ones.-->

- collateralType => disabled
- collateralType => collateralizationRatio

### Test Cases

<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for SIPs but can be included with the implementation..-->

TBC

### Configurable Values (Via SCCP)

<!--Please list all values configurable via SCCP under this implementation.-->

Values of the mapping, if Spartan Council was the pool owner.
