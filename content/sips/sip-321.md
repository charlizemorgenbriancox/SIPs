## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

This SIP proposes adding various improvements to the core system which will improve user and developer experience.

## Motivation

<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the SIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the SIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is inaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the SIP will address the issue!-->

Since development of markets and front-end applications has begun on the V3 core system, minor changes have been identified that will greatly improve the developer experience for integrators. This SIP summarizes these changes.

## Rationale

<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs. The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

- The `getUsdToken` and `getOracleManager` methods will allow integrators to fetch the address of the stablecoin and oracle manager systems being used by a particular deployment of the core system directly, rather than finding the appropriate addresses off-chain.
- The _Constant Node_ to the oracle manager will streamline the creation of test scenarios and also has production use cases (such as ensuring that a minimum price would be returned in combination with a reducer node).
- The `createAccount()` method (which does not require a `requestedAccountId` parameter) automatically generates a valid account ID, creates the account, and returns the ID. This will simplify smart contract integrations which create accounts and remove the possibility of account creation failure due to the same account ID being requested in the same block.
- The `locked` method in the `IMarket` interface will be renamed to `minimumCredit`. This should more clearly reflect that the value returned by this function represents the minimum credit capacity that the market expects from the pools providing it with liquidity. Although this is a breaking interface change, we know that no externally developed markets are in production due to [SIP-310](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-310/).

## Technical Specification

<!--The technical specification should outline the public API of the changes proposed. That is, changes to any of the interfaces Synthetix currently exposes or the creations of new ones.-->

- `getUsdToken()` will be added to the market manager module and return the relevant value from storage.
- `getOracleManager()` will be added to the market manager module and return the relevant value from storage.
- The Constant Node will take a `int256 price` parameter, which it will always return when processed with `block.timestamp` as the timestamp.
- The existing `createAccount()` method will restrict usage of the upper half of values available for the account ID. The new `createAccount()` method will use the next available value in the upper half of values, returning the ID used after creating the account.
- `locked` should be renamed to `minimumCredit` in all relevant locations in the codebase.

### Test Cases

<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for SIPs but can be included with the implementation..-->

Relevant tests will be developed during implementation.

### Configurable Values (Via SCCP)

<!--Please list all values configurable via SCCP under this implementation.-->
