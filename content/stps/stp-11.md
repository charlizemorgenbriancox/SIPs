## Simple Summary

This is the suggested template for new STPs. Note that  an STP number will be assigned by an editor.

This STP allocates $70,000 to fund a dedicated Operations Analyst to support Treasury Council (TC) activities. This role is important for operational efficiency and maintaining continuity, onboarding, and upkeep as TC members are elected each epoch.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what _will_ be done if the STP is implemented, not _why_ it should be done or _how_ it will be done. If the STP proposes sending X tokens to Y each week, write, "we propose to send X tokens to Y each week".-->

This STP outlines the proposal to appoint a Operations Analyst with an indicative annual stipend of $70,000, complemented by an SNX grant vested over a specified period. The role will handle communications, record-keeping, transaction staging and review, minute-taking during meetings, and coordination with the Synthetix community, DAOs and Core Contributors.


## Motivation

<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the STP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the STP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is inaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the STP will address the issue!-->

Given the Treasury Council’s evolving responsibilities and the periodic re-election of its members, there is a pressing need for a stable role that ensures continuity, responsiveness and institutional memory. This role will serve as a constant, aiding in the onboarding of new TC members and maintaining the upkeep of ongoing projects and responsibilities.


## Specification

<!--The specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature, there are five sections
1. Overview
2. Rationale
3. Financial Specification
4. Configurable Values
-->

### Overview

<!--This is a high level overview of *how* the STP will solve the problem. The overview should clearly describe how the new feature will be implemented.-->
The role will provide essential support to the Treasury Council, ensuring seamless operations and continuity despite the periodic cycling of TC members. This role will enhance the Council's efficiency and maintain the integrity of ongoing projects and initiatives.

See the [job description](/assets/stp-11/job-description.md)

### Rationale
<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose this use of funds – what were the considerations. The rationale fleshes out the motivation and reasoning behind decisions that were made. It should describe any alternate ideas that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

The introduction of this role addresses the need for a consistent presence within the Treasury Council’s operations. This continuity is crucial for preserving the Council’s momentum and institutional knowledge, especially during transitions between epochs.

### Financial Specification
<!--The financial specification should outline the the tokens, amounts, destinations, and schedule of funds to be moved. If appropriate, any technical considerations should also be included here – that is, changes to any of the interfaces Synthetix currently exposes or the creations of new ones.-->

Allocate the below compensation to fund this role for 1 year:

- An indicative annual stipend of $70,000.
- An appropriate SNX grant.
