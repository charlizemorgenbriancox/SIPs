## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the variable change proposed.-->

## Motivation

<!--The motivation is critical for SCCPs that want to update variables within Synthetix. It should clearly explain why the existing variable is not incentive aligned. SCCP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->

In order to improve network health, the minimum C-ratio should be increased to 500% immediately.
