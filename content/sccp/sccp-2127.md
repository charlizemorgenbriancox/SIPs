# Motivation

The above markets are to be deprecated as per [SIP-2051](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-2051/), [SCCP-2125](https://sips.synthetix.io/sccp/sccp-2125/) and [SCCP-2108](https://sips.synthetix.io/sccp/sccp-2108/). However, some users continue to have out standing positions and margin, this SCCP proposes to send the margin associated with those markets to Treasury Council who would cater for refunds on a case by case basis.
