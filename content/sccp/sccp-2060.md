# Simple Summary

This SCCP proposes to update the ETH Wrapper configurations as per the below:
- Lower the burnFeeRate to zero from 50 bp
- Lowers the `maxTokenAmount` to zero from 20k ETH

# Abstract

Below is a description of the parameter changes propopsed in the SCCP:
- `burnFeeRate` is the rate paid when unwraping ETH by burning sETH
- `maxTokenAmount` is the maximum amount of sETH that can be minted with ETH

# Motivation

The proposed parameter changes are meant to facilitate arbitrage of the peg on L1, with arbitrages taking place by:
- buying cheap sUSD on L2
- bridging it to L1
- swapping to sETH at 5 bp
- unwrapping it to ETH
- Swapping the ETH to USDC
