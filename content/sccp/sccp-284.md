# Simple Summary

This SCCP proposes to increase the non-atomic `exchangeFeeRate` on trades to sETH and sBTC to 35 bp, from 10 bp and 25 bp respectively.

# Abstract

The `exchangeFeeRate` is the fee applied on trades into a given currency key.


# Motivation

The main motivation is the chainlink heartbeat of [50 bp](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/price-feeds/addresses), vis-a-vis the low trading fees being offered on exchanges to sETH and sBTC, opening up a gap for latency arbitrage.
