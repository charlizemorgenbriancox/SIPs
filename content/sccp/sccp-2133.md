## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the SCCP.-->

The TC plans to buy sUSD on optimism in order to help with the peg. However, given the need for sUSD liquidity on ethereum, to manage cratio, they request that they receive the sUSD immediately on ethereum. Hence This SCCP proposes, to facilitate this transaction with TC sending sUSD 10 million to pdao, pdao burning the sUSD on optimism and minting an equivalent amount on ethereum to the TC. No impact on the debt pool would materialize from executing this SCCP.

## Motivation

<!--The motivation is critical for SCCPs that want to update variables within Synthetix. It should clearly explain why the existing variable is not incentive aligned. SCCP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->

The changes entail the TC sending sUSD to pdao on optimism. Pdao burns the sUSD on optimism and mints an equivalent amount on ethereum.
