# Simple Summary

This SCCP proposes to lower the skew scale parameters on SOL from 5,625,000 to 2,812,500.

# Abstract

Below is a description of the parameter changes proposed in the SCCP:
- `skewScale` is the scaling factor of the relevant market in the underlying currency for computing PD and Funding Rates.

# Motivation

The proposed parameter changes on skew scale aim at increasing the incentive on arbitrageurs to arbitrage the skew by targeting an effective liquidity comfortably below liquidity available on centralized exchanges.
