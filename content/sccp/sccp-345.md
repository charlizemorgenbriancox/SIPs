# Simple Summary
This SCCP proposes to reconfigure collateral asset parameters on Arbitrum to limit USDx supply until there is sufficient demand for USDx once Perps trading is live.

# Abstract
The following issuance ratios are proposed:

- wstETH: 350%
- stataUSDT: 200%
- stataUSDC: 200%
- USDe: 200%
- SUSDe: 200% 
- wEETH: 350%
- USDC: 200%
- ETH: 300%
- ARB: 350%

# Motivation
These changes will limit USDx supply until sufficient trading activity exists to maintain the peg. Additionally, Ramses/Curve is being engaged alongside incentives to support deep USDx liquidity & the use of wrappers.
