# Simple Summary

This SCCP aims at improving the user experience on Perps V2 with the following changes, matching the configurations on the v3 network:
- Raise the `skewScale` parameter on the SOL market to 2.8m, from 2.1m
- Lower the `maxFundingVelocity` on the SOL market to 9 from 36
- Lower the `maxFundingVelocity` on the ETH and BTC market to 4 from 9
- Raise the `maxMarketValue` on the SOL market to 550 thousand (100m USD)

# Abstract

The definitions of the parameter being proposed to change are as follows: 
- `skewScale` is the scaling factor of the relevant market in the underlying currency for computing PD and Funding Rates
- `maxFundingVelocity` is the main parameter that allows to nudge funding rates
- `maxMarketValue` is the max market value of the relevant market in the underlying currency


# Motivation

The proposed changes are in light of the utilization on the SOL perp market, as well as aligning the funding rate and slippage experience on v3.
