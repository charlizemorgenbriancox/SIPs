# Simple Summary

This SCCP proposes to deploy a USDC wrapper with 70 million dollar cap on optimism with 0 fees.
Furthermore, this sccp also proposes to decrease the wrapper cap on USDe to zero and increase the burnFeeRate to 10 bp. Note that decreasing the cap would only be implemented after partner integrators (1inch, odos, kwenta...) put in place the necessary for on-boarding the USDC wrapper.

# Abstract

Wrappers can be setup by calling createWrapper under the WrapperFactor contract. The parameters of the call would be:

- token: `0x29C78b718b6790852FDCC0ADAB7166Bf6E86965D`
- currencyKey: `sUSD`
- synthContractName: `SynthsUSD`


# Motivation

The change is in order to improving the trading user experience as USDC is the defacto stable coin of choice for most users.
