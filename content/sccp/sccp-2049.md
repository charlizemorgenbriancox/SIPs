# Simple Summary

This SCCP proposes to lower the skew scale parameter on the APE market from `45,000,000` to  `25,000,000`.
The slippage on 100k$ on a centralized exchange amounts to 5 bp, while synthetix's slippage would be slightly above 15 bp after these changes are implemented.

# Abstract

The description of the parameters changes is as follows: 
- `skewScale` is the scaling factor of the relevant market in the underlying currency for computing PD and Funding Rates.

# Motivation

The main motivation is to increase the incentive on arbitrageurs to arbitrage the skew by targeting an effective liquidity comfortably below liquidity available on centralized exchanges.
