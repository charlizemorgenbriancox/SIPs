# Simple Summary

This SCCP proposes to lower the open interest capacity on perps v1 markets gradually, as traders unwind their position. This SCCP can only be implemented subsequent to [SCCP-277](https://sips.synthetix.io/sccp/sccp-277/).

# Abstract

The parameters configuration that would be changed is `maxMarketValueUSD` which would be lowered iteratively to the amount of open interest available until the `maxMarketValueUSD` reaches zero.


# Motivation

The main motivation is to unwind in the least disruptive manner the perps v1 markets.
