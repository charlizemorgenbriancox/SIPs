## Simple Summary

The SCCP proposes to redeem `0xb84acf5af9132680876ccef334f7d6f8b4599c16` at parity. This is done by increasing the `discountRate` to 1, executing the redemption on the sBTC held by the user and setting `discount` rate to 60%.

# Abstract

The `discountRate`, described in [SIP-2059](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-2059/),  determines the rate which users can redeem their synths for sUSD.

## Motivation

The `discountRate` is currently set to 75%, as per [SCCP-2105](https://sips.synthetix.io/sccp/sccp-2105/) in order to encourage volatile synth holders to redeem their synths to sUSD and help rebalance the long skew. However, users who hold volatile synths, can request from governance to be redeemed at parity.
