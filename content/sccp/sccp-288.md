## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the SCCP.-->

Lower the `issueFeeRate` on the collateral short contract to 10 bp from 40 bp.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the variable change proposed.-->

The `issueFeeRate` is the rate paid on opening or drawing on a short position.

## Motivation

<!--The motivation is critical for SCCPs that want to update variables within Synthetix. It should clearly explain why the existing variable is not incentive aligned. SCCP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->

Currently shorts are exclusively used by the lyra contracts, although the lyra protocol will switch over to the perps implementation in the coming months, the proposed parameter changes will help reduce the cost on lyra users and improve the user experience.
