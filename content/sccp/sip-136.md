## Simple Summary
<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the SCCP.-->

Increase the inflationary rewards on L2 to 100k per week.

## Abstract
<!--A short (~200 word) description of the variable change proposed.-->

With the implementation of [SIP-170](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-170), there is currently 25k SNX distributed to L2 per week from the inflationary supply. This SCCP proposes increasing that amount to 100k per week, to incentivise stakers to begin migrating to L2.


## Motivation
<!--The motivation is critical for SCCPs that want to update variables within Synthetix. It should clearly explain why the existing variable is not incentive aligned. SCCP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->

Since exchanging is now live on L2, it makes sense to begin slowly increasing the sUSD supply. Currently there is only ~5.7M sUSD.

Increasing the inflationary rewards will allow the sUSD supply to begin expanding slowly, whilst the L2 rollout is still protected via the high c-ratio, which is currently at 1000% (pending a reduction to 900% as seen in [SCCP-134](https://sips.synthetix.io/sccp/sccp-134)).
