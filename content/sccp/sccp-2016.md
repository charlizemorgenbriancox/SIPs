# Simple Summary

This SCCP proposes to update the maxMarketValue of FLOW and PEPE as per the below:

| **Market** 	| **Current** 	| **Proposed** 	| **Change** 	|
|:------------:	|:-----------:	|:------------:	|:----------:	|
|   **sPEPE**  	|    600 b    	|    1200 b    	|   +600 B   	|
|   **sFLOW**  	|     100k    	|     400k     	|    +300k   	|

# Abstract

Below is a description of the parameter being changed:
- `maxMarketValue` is the maximum amount of open interest allowed on long and short positions in a given perp market.

# Motivation

The primary motivation is the increase utilization of these markets. It is worth mentioning that [binance OI](https://www.binance.com/en/futures/funding-history/perpetual/trading-data) for PEPE and FLOW are 85m$ and 8m$ respectively, while the proposed Synthetix parameters are 1.7m$ and 300k$, hence, the parameters are still reasonably conservative.
