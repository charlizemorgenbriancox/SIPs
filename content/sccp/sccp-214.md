## Simple Summary

This SCCP proposes to increase maker/taker fees on silver futures to 20 and 25 bp from 15 and 15 bp.

## Abstract

`makerFeePrice` and `takerFeePrice` are the fees paid by traders when filled for futures orders.

## Motivation

The reason behind the fee increase is the inherent latency in commodity feeds, vis-a-vis their crypto market counterparts. Raising fees reduces the chance of latency arbitrages.
