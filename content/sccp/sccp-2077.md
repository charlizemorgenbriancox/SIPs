# Simple Summary

This SCCP proposes to implement the following:

1) Cover the below markets under the MMV control module,  outlined in [SIP-2048](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-2048/):

2) Adding the gnosis safe [`0x4324e64d4Fa6c63900987dafBA5343155561Da96`](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x4324e64d4Fa6c63900987dafBA5343155561Da96)  as an endorsed account. The endorsed account is a `3 of n` multisig, with 1 of the accounts being a deployer, while the rest of the accounts being the current owners on PDAO. 
It is worth noting, that PDAO would only be able to stage/execute a transaction that utilizes the module, if they receive specific instructions to do so from the interim risk council, designated by the Spartan Council.  

3) Unpause the MMV risk control module [`0x5202A7d3d12B55Dde116f0f35c94Ca9acCD04ae6`](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x5202A7d3d12B55Dde116f0f35c94Ca9acCD04ae6)

# Abstract

- `setCoverage` allows to configure markets that can be acted upon by the MMV risk control module.
- `setEndorsedAccount` allows the configuration of the account that is able to take action on the module.
- `setPaused` allows to unpause the MMV risk control module.

# Motivation

The motivation is to enable to MMV risk module, that is able to decrease the `maxMarketValue` to zero, when Liquidity Providers are exposed to the risk of a market skew that can't be hedged with external exchange markets. 

Note that as per [SIP-2048](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-2048/#risk-control-module-usage) the interim risk council directly reports to the Spartan Council and is held accountable for actions and strategies employed that utilize the usage of the risk control module. Accountability takes the form of a presentation that lays out the status of the automated tools employed that utilize the risk control module, the prevailing configurations and any changes or alterations performed. The IRC would also present to the SC a report on all actions taken that utilize the module. The Spartan Council can at any point withdraw this responsibility from the IRC, and in such a case, the module is to be rendered deprecated by setting the modules' status into a Paused state.
