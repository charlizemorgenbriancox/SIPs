## Simple Summary

This SCCP proposes to lower the oi caps on all markets on arbitrum to zero.

## Abstract

The cap can be lowered by reducing the `maxMarketValue` and `maxMarketSize` to zero.

## Motivation

Intentions to wind down the arbitrum deploy requires that markets switch to close-only mode. Lowering the oi parameters to zero allows traders to exit their position at their leisure.
