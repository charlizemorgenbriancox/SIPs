# Simple Summary

This SCCP proposes to reduce the `issuanceRatio` ratio from 20% currently (i.e. 500% cratio) to 2.5% (i.e 4000% cratio).

# Abstract

The issuance ratio is the ratio that determines the maximum amount of sUSD that can be minted for a staked amount of snx collateral.

# Motivation

The increase in collateralization ratio is to promote system health.
