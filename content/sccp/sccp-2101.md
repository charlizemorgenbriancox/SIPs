# Simple Summary

This SCCP proposes to reduce the `issuanceRatio` ratio from 20% currently (i.e. 500% cratio) to 2.5% (i.e 4000% cratio).

# Abstract

The issuance ratio is the ratio that determines the maximum amount of sUSD that can be minted for a staked amount of snx collateral.

# Motivation

The increase in collateralization ratio is temporary until [SIP-2059](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-2059) is rolled out over the upcoming month. Note that snx stakers' liquidation ratio will remain  unchanged at 160% and this SCCP does not increase or affect the state of an account getting liquidated. Furthermore, stakers can always repay their debt partially via the [staking site](https://staking.synthetix.io/burn) if they wish to do so. Lastly, SNX stakers do not need to burn to target to claim their weekly fees as per [SIP-255](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-255/).
