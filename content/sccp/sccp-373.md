# Simple Summary

This SCCP proposes to update the trading fee distribution split as per the below:

|     **Split**    | **Existing Config.** | **New Config.** |
|:----------------:|:--------------------:|:---------------:|
| **v2 Debt Burn** |          40%         |       20%       |
|    **V3 LPs**    |          40%         |       60%       |
|  **Integrators** |          20%         |       20%       |

It is important to mention that Treasury, signaled their intention to help supplement the v3 lp apy, by using part of their integrator fees in order to partially settle the v3 lp's debt. This would be performed at Treasury's descrition.

# Motivation

The main motivation is to boost the LP apy by increasing their share of trading fees.
