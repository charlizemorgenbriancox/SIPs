# Simple Summary

This SCCP proposes to increase the `maxFundingVelocity` to 27 from 9 on the BCH, XRP and FTM markets.

# Abstract

The `maxFundingVelocity` is the parameter that helps calibrate the speed by which funding rate changes for a given level of skew & skew scale.

# Motivation

The main motivation is to help promote arbitrages of the skew, by allowing funding to settle back into neutrality at a faster pace, when outsized positions are executed on the debt pool that flip the skew from short to long or vice-versa.
