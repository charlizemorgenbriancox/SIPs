# Simple Summary

This SCCP proposes to lower the `minimumStakeTime` on ethereum to 1 second from 7 days.

# Abstract
`minimumStakeTime` is the minimum amount of time an account can be staked on v2x, before he can burn max and release his SNX. 

# Motivation

The proposed change is in light of [SCCP-2134](https://sips.synthetix.io/sccp/sccp-2134/) which effectively restricted staking on v2x Ethereum.
