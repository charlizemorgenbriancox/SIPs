# Simple Summary

This SCCP proposes to raise the `minKeeperFee` to 4$ from 2$

# Abstract

The `minKeeperFee` is the fee paid to the bots for executing a given perp trade

# Motivation

The main motivation is the recent surge in gas cost which has priced out all decentralized keepers and increased the load on the centralized keeper funded by Treasury and is burning around 2 ETH per day.
