<!--You can leave these HTML comments in your merged SCCP and delete the visible duplicate text guides, they will not appear and may be helpful to refer to if you edit it again.

When opening a pull request to submit your SCCP, please use an abbreviated title in the filename, `sccp-draft_title_abbrev.md`. The title should be 44 characters or less.-->

## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the SCCP.-->

Increase the account merge duration to 2 years and put into effect a new merging window.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the variable change proposed.-->

Proposing to change the account `accountMergingDuration` state variable to 2 years and triggering the `startMergingWindow` method in order to start a new merging epoch.

## Motivation

<!--The motivation is critical for SCCPs that want to update variables within Synthetix. It should clearly explain why the existing variable is not incentive aligned. SCCP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->


The merge window, currently configured on the chain, expired on the 25th of November. Users are requesting to re-enable it to facilitate the movement of their escrowed entries to new addresses, including the author of this SCCP.  With inflation being switched off, it is anticipated that there won't be a significant need for this functionality within a one-year timeframe. This is because the majority of escrowed SNX would likely have already vested, except for liquidation rewards.
