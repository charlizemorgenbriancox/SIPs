# Simple Summary

Increase the `maxPriceDivergence` parameter for all Perps V2 markets from 2% to 10%.

## Abstract

The `maxPriceDivergence` setting is used to prevent trades from confirming when there are large deviations between the onchain Chainlink price and the offchain Pyth price. The setting is intended to prevent trading on bad price updates, however the current setting restricts trading during volatile periods. During the time when Pyth prices have moved but Chainlink hasn't yet updated, trades at the market price will revert.

## Motivation

Increasing the `maxPriceDivergence` setting will allow trading to continue during volatility and prevent keepers from spending significant gas on trades that will revert.
