# Simple Summary

This SCCP proposes to lower the `exchangeFeeRate` on sETH synth exchanges with fee reclamation on L1 from 35 bp to 5 bp.

# Abstract

The `exchangeFeeRate` is the fee rate applied on the amount being exchanged via conventional synth exchanges with fee reclamation. 

# Motivation

The proposed parameter changes are meant to facilitate arbitrage of the peg on L1, with arbitrages taking place by:
- buying cheap sUSD on L2
- bridging it to L1
- swapping to sETH at 5 bp
- unwrapping it to ETH
- Swapping the ETH to USDC
