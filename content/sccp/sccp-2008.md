## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the SCCP.-->

This SCCP intends to deprecate Perps V1 Markets by increasing the margin requirement on existing positions. Perps V1 Markets have been in close-only since [SIP-278](https://sips.synthetix.io/sccp/sccp-278/), implemented 3 months ago, but there remains around sUSD 150k worth of positions outstanding.

Deprecation is implemented by raising the `liquidationBufferRatio` by 5 percentage points per week, for a 3 month duration. After 3 months, the `liquidationBufferRatio` is increased to a level that would cause the rest of the outstanding positions to be closed by liquidation. Furthermore, the `liquidationFeeRatio` would be lowered from 35 bp to 2 bp immediately.

Note that existing positions can still be accessed via Kwenta on [this link](https://v1.kwenta.eth.limo/market/).

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the variable change proposed.-->

- The `liquidationBufferRatio` represents the proportion of a given position's size that needs to be collateralized by sUSD margin. Accounts who dont maintain enough margin to meet the `liquidationBufferRatio` requirement can be liquidated. 
- The `liquidationFeeRatio` is the compensation paid to the keeper in order to trigger a liquidation on a given position.

## Motivation

<!--The motivation is critical for SCCPs that want to update variables within Synthetix. It should clearly explain why the existing variable is not incentive aligned. SCCP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->

The primary motivation is to enforce sunsetting of outstanding positions in PerpsV1 in the least intrusive manner, leaving enough time for accounts with existing positions to close their positions.
The total size per market (i.e. longs + shorts) in PerpsV1 contracts can be found below and the accounts and kwenta smart-contracts holding outstanding positions can be found under the [asset folder](https://github.com/Synthetixio/SIPs/blob/master/content/sccp/asset/sccp-2008/perps_v1_positions.csv):
