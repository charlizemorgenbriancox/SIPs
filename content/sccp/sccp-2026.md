# Simple Summary

This SCCP proposes to decrease the `offchainDelayedOrderMinAge` parameter on both the ETH and BTC markets to 1 second from 2 seconds.

# Abstract

The `offchainDelayedOrderMinAge`` represents the least amount of time that needs to elapse, since the order intention time, before a delayed offchain order can be executed.

# Motivation

The primary motivation is to significantly improve the PerpsV2 user experience, by decreasing the amount of time needed for a delayed order to be executed.
