# Simple Summary

This SCCP proposes to update the XRP skew scale parameter from 750 million to 300 million.

# Abstract

The parameter description is as follows:
- The `skewScale` parameter helps determine the premium and discount applied for a given level of skewness in a given market. 

# Motivation

The proposed change is due to the recent market action where offchain slippage for large sizes has increased significantly due to recent events, the change proposed in this sccp helps brings perps in line with markets and paves the way for arbitrages to rebalance the xrp perp market.
