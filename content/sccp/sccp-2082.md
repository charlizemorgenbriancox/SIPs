# Simple Summary

This SCCP proposes to unpause the below perp markets once deployed::
- [SIP-2056](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-2056/) STRK
- [SIP-2053](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-2053/) JUP
- [SIP-2054](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-2054/) PENDLE
- [SIP-2052](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-2052/) CVX

The below parameters would be applied on the new markets:

| **Market** | **MaxMarketValue** | **Max MarketValueUSD** | **SkewScale** | **Slippage/100K$** |
|:----------:|:------------------:|:----------------------:|:-------------:|:------------------:|
|     CVX    |       40,000       |        $181,000        |    750,000    |         147        |
|     JUP    |      2,000,000     |        $949,600        |   22,500,000  |         47         |
|   PENDLE   |       250,000      |        $695,750        |   2,500,000   |         72         |
|    STRK    |       500,000      |       $1,023,300       |   5,400,000   |         45         |

Aside from the changes above, the perps markets will have the following configurations as well:
- offchain Maker/Taker fees: 2 bp / 10 bp
- offchainDelayedOrderMinAge: 2 seconds
- offchainDelayedOrderMaxAge: 60 seconds
- maxFundingVelocity: 36
- liquidationBufferRatio: 150 bp
- liquidationPremiumMultiplier: 3
- maxLeverage: 27.5
- offchainPriceDivergence: 10%
- maxLiquidationDelta: maker+taker offchain fees 
- maxPD: maxLiquidationDelta * 2
- dynamicFeeRounds: 1
- maxDynamicFeeRate: 10%
- All the markets being covered by the risk module

The parameters for deprecated trading paths (atomic and delayed) are as follows:
- nextPriceConfirmWindow: 2
- delayedOrderConfirmWindow: 120 seconds
- minDelayTimeDelta: 60 seconds
- maxDelayTimeDelta: 6000 seconds
- taker & maker fees on delayed orders (not-offchain) and atomic orders: 30%

# Abstract

The parameters configurations description is as follows:
- maker/taker offchain delayed orders pertain to fees charged with the pyth offchain route
- maxMarketValue is the max market value of the relevant market in the underlying currency
- skewScale is the scaling factor of the relevant market in the underlying currency for computing PD and Funding Rates
- liquidationBufferRatio and liquidationPremiumMultiplier are parameters that determine the safety buffer required for liquidations
- minDelayTimeDelta is the minimum period after which delayed orders can be executed
- maxDelayTimeDelta is the maximum period before which delayed orders can be executed
- offchainDelayedOrderMinAge is the minimum delay before which offchain orders can be executed
- offchainDelayedOrderMaxAge is the maximum delay after which offchain orders cannot be executed
- maxFundingVelocity is the main parameter that allows to nudge funding rates
- offchainPriceDivergence is the maximum allowable delta between chainlink and pyth prices
- dynamicFeeRounds and maxDynamicFeeRate are set to the above specified parameters, via DirectIntegrationManager, effectively disabling dynamic fees on perp markets (due to legacy code base)
- Markets being covered under the risk control module is explained under [SIP-2048](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-2048/)

Parameters for trading paths (atomic and delayed orders) which are set for deprecation but need to be specified: 
- makerFee/takerFee fees pertain to fees for atomic trades at chainlink price, which have been deprecated via high fees
- maker/taker delayed fees pertain to fees for trades at the next chainlink price, which have been deprecated via high fees
- nextPriceConfirmWindow is the window, in chainlink rounds, in which next price delayed orders can be triggered, a deprecated path for trading
- delayedOrderConfirmWindow is the minimum number of seconds after which next price delayed orders can be triggered if no new chainlink rounds are available, a deprecated path for trading

# Motivation

The main motivation is to  launch the markets specified above.
