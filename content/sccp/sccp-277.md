# Simple Summary

This SCCP proposes unpause the new perp markets and specify/update their parameters as per the below configuration:

Aside from these changes, the perps markets will have the following configurations:
- liquidationBufferRatio: 100 bp
- liquidationRatioMultiplier: 1
- nextPriceConfirmWindow: 2
- delayedOrderConfirmWindow: 120 seconds
- minDelayTimeDelta: 60 seconds
- maxDelayTimeDelta: 6000 seconds
- offchainDelayedOrderMinAge: 15 seconds
- offchainDelayedOrderMaxAge: 120 seconds
- maxFundingVelocity: 3%
- offchainPriceDivergence: 2%
- dynamicFeeRounds: 1
- maxDynamicFeeRate: 10%


# Abstract

The parameters configurations description is as follows:
- makerFee/takerFee fees pertain to fees for atomic trades at chainlink price
- maker/taker delayed fees pertain to fees for trades at the next chainlink price
- maker/taker offchain delayed orders pertain to fees charged with the pyth offchain route
- maxMarketValue is the max market value of the relevant market in the underlying currency
- skewScale is the scaling factor of the relevant market in the underlying currency for computing PD and Funding Rates
- liquidationBufferRatio and liquidationRatioMultiplier consists of the safety buffer on liquidations
- nextPriceConfirmWindow is the window, in chainlink rounds, in which next price delayed orders can be triggered
- delayedOrderConfirmWindow is the minimum number of seconds after which next price delayed orders can be triggered if no new chainlink rounds are available
- minDelayTimeDelta is the minimum period after which delayed orders can be executed
- maxDelayTimeDelta is the maximum period before which delayed orders can be executed
- offchainDelayedOrderMinAge is the minimum delay before which offchain orders can be executed
- offchainDelayedOrderMaxAge is the maximum delay after which offchain orders cannot be executed
- maxFundingVelocity is the main parameter that allows to nudge funding rates
- offchainPriceDivergence is the maximum allowable delta between chainlink and pyth prices
- setting dynamicFeeRounds and maxDynamicFeeRate to the above specified parameters, via DirectIntegrationManager, effectively disables dynamic fees on perp markets



# Motivation

The main motivation is to finalize the launch of the markets specified in [SIP-295](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-295/) and [SIP-2000](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-2000/).
