# Simple Summary

This SCCP aims at improving the user experience by 
- Raising the USDe wrapper cap on optimism to 30m from the previously proposed limit of 15m
- Lowering the caps on all the wrappers on ethereum to 0

# Abstract

The `maxTokenAmount` is the maximum amount of underlying that can be wrapped to mint sUSD.


# Motivation

The proposed changes are in light of increased usage of the USDe wrapper on optimism by traders, to acquire synths and get back the underlying. `USDe` being instantly bridgeable via [stargate](https://stargate.finance/) makes the usage  of `USDe` ideal.
