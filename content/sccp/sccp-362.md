# Simple Summary
To attract and retain high caliber Spartan Council members, reduce the quorum requirements for a governance presentation to 3 members. 

# Abstract
Reduce the quorum requirement of governance presentations to 3 Spartan Council members, a reduction from n/2+1 to n/2-1. The author of the presentation must also be present, unless someone else is nominated to present on their behalf.

# Motivation

The requirement to have n/2+1 Spartan Council members attend every governance presentation is a hindrance for attracting and retaining high-impact, strategic Spartan Council members. The Spartan Council is able to discuss and vote on proposals without requiring majority attendance at presentations. It is the role of the operational seats of the Spartan Council to circulate and facilitate the discussion with the Spartan Council members, including feedback from the community.
