# Simple Summary
Make off-chain markets (XUA, XAG, EUR, AUD, GBP) close only, in preparation for migration to Perps v3.

# Abstract
Set `maxMarketSize` = 0 for XUA, XAG, EUR, AUD, GBP on Perps V2.

# Motivation
Offchain assets require logic for trading hours that has proved unreliable - most recently falsely activating the forex and commodity perp markets on Christmas Eve. Moving offchain markets to close only on Perps V2 will provide time for the offchain logic to be improved, before launching on Perps V3.
