# Simple Summary

This SCCP proposes to lower the `maxMarketValue` and `maxMarketSize` on RNDR to zero (i.e. close mode), given the  upcoming token swap.

# Abstract

The `maxMarketValue` governs the US Dollar maximum open interest possible for that market.
The `maxMarketSize` governs the maximum open interest denominated in the market's currencyKey.

# Motivation

The main motivation is the token swap and delisting of the legacy token by centralized exchanges.
