# Simple Summary

This SCCP proposes to lower the `maxMarketValue` on RNDR to zero (i.e. close mode), given the  upcoming token swap.

# Abstract

The `maxMarketValue` governs the US Dollar maximum open interest possible for that market.

# Motivation

The main motivation is the token swap and delisting of the legacy token by centralized exchanges.
