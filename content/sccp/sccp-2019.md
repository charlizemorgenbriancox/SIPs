# Simple Summary

This SCCP proposes to lower the maker fee for offchain trades on FTM and BCH markets to zero from 2 bp.

# Abstract

The parameter description is as follows:
- The maker offchain delayed order fee is the fee charged in order to derisk the debt pool from an imbalanced skew.

# Motivation

As can be seen for the [BCH](https://dune.com/queries/2694676/4482559?asset_t6c1ea=BCH) and [FTM](https://dune.com/queries/2694676/4482559?asset_t6c1ea=FTM) remain imbalanced for longer period of time when compared to the more liquid ETH and BTC markets. This SCCP will allow us to understand the elasticity of demand for arbitrages when faced with no potential upfront fees for executing trades that derisk the debt pool.
