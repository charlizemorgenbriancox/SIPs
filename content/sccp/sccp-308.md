## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the SCCP.-->

This SCCP proposes to update the L1 and L2 gas unit parameters as per the following [PR](https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix-deployments/pull/154/files).

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the variable change proposed.-->

The L1 and L2 gas units are configured  in order to covers keepers' cost of executing transactions, as described in detail under [SIP-362](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-362/). The units represent the base gas units that usually are used in order to perform trade settlement, flagging of accounts for liquidation and eventually executing the liquidation that closes the users' liquidated position.  

## Motivation

<!--The motivation is critical for SCCPs that want to update variables within Synthetix. It should clearly explain why the existing variable is not incentive aligned. SCCP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->

The parameters are updated to reflect the changes in the codebase following the ecotone upgrade.
