# Abstract

The parameter description is as follows:
- The `maxMarketValue` is the maximum potential size of a given perp market on either the long or short side. 

# Motivation

The proposed change in the parameter should allow more trades to materialize on these market which have seen an increase in activity. Note that the parameters are still conservative vis-a-vis the open interest sizes seen on centralized exchanges.
