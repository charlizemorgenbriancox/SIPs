## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the SCCP.-->

Increase the `burnFeeRate` from 5 bp to 5% on the ETH wrapper on ethereum

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the variable change proposed.-->

The `burnFeeRate` is paid to snx stakers for burning sETH to unlock the ETH.

## Motivation

<!--The motivation is critical for SCCPs that want to update variables within Synthetix. It should clearly explain why the existing variable is not incentive aligned. SCCP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->

The main motivation is to lock in the amount of synth liquidity circulating on ethereum and maximize the exchange volume that results from arbitrage across the different curve LPs.
