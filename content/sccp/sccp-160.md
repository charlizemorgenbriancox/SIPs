## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the SCCP.-->

This SCCP proposes to update the following parameters on the LUSD wrappr on L2:

- Increase the capacity by 25 million sUSD to 100 million sUSD

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the variable change proposed.-->

The LUSD cap sets the maximum amount of sUSD that can be minted by the wrappr.

## Motivation

<!--The motivation is critical for SCCPs that want to update variables within Synthetix. It should clearly explain why the existing variable is not incentive aligned. SCCP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->

Raising the LUSD wrappr capacity is recommended as the cap has now been reached.
