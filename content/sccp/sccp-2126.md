# Simple Summary

This SCCP proposes to increase the min collateralization ratio back to 500% (or 20% in `issuanceRatio` terms).

# Abstract

The issuance ratio is the ratio that determines the maximum amount of sUSD that can be minted for a staked amount of snx collateral.


# Motivation

The min c-ratio was recently lowered via an emergency decision as per [SCCP-2122](https://sips.synthetix.io/sccp/sccp-2122/). This SCCP proposes to undo SCCP-2122 by setting the min cratio back to previous levels, given that the risks to the stability of the protocol are asymmetrically more pronounced if a price recovery materializes.
