# Simple Summary

This SCCP proposes to update the parameters of the [dynamic gas fee module](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xF4bc5588aAB8CBB412baDd3674094ECF808286f6#readContract), described in [SIP-2003](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-2013/) as per the below:

|        **Parameter**       	| **Current** 	| **Proposed** 	|
|:--------------------------:	|:-----------:	|:------------:	|
|     **profitMarginUSD**    	|      2      	|       1      	|
|   **profitMarginPercent**  	|     30%     	|      30%     	|
| **minKeeperFeeUpperBound** 	|      15     	|      30      	|
| **minKeeperFeeLowerBound** 	|      1      	|      0.1     	|
|       **gasUnitsL1**       	|    30,000   	|    30,000    	|
|       **gasUnitsL2**       	|   1.20E+06  	|   1.20E+06   	|

# Abstract

Below is a description on the parameters being updated:
- `profitMarginUSD` is the amount in USD, paid to the keeper on top of cost of execution.
- `profitMarginPercent` also helps scale the incentive for keepers to execute as the cost of execution rises.
- `minKeeperFeeLowerBound` is the lowest reward possible paid to the keeper.
- `minKeeperFeeUpperBound` is the largest reward possible paid to the keeper.

# Motivation

The primary motivation behind these parameter changes is to make transaction execution more affordable to users during times of low gas prices, while also ensuring that decentralized keepers continue to receive fair compensation during times of high gas prices. Below showcases the `minKeeperFee` as a function of the ethereum gas prices at a 1800$ ETH/USD price:
