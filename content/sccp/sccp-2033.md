# Simple Summary

This SCCP proposes to lower the WLD skew scale from 33 million to 20 million.

# Abstract

Skew scale is the scaling factor of the relevant market in the underlying currency for computing PD and Funding Rates

# Motivation

The main motivation is the recent review of data suggests that slippage is much more pronounced on exchanges and warrant a lower skew scale in order to ensure that delta neutral arbitrages materialize on chain.
