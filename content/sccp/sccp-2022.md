# Simple Summary

This SCCP proposes to update the `maxLiquidationDelta` and `maxPD` parameters to 10 and 20 bp respectively on the FTM and BCH markets.

# Abstract

`maxPD` (MPD) and `maxLiquidationDelta` (MLD) are parameters introduced in [SIP-2005](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-2005/) and they are set by governance taking into account the below rules:
- `maxPD` is set to 2 * (offchain maker fee + offchain taker fee)
- `maxLiquidationDelta` is set to offchain maker + offchain taker fees
These parameters determine whether an account can be liquidated spontaneously or exclusively by endorsed Liquidators.

# Motivation

The proposed changes in this SCCP are necessary, in order to continue to execute liquidations safely, taking into account changes to the makerFee proposed in [SCCP-2019](https://sips.synthetix.io/sccp/sccp-2019/).
