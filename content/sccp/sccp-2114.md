# Simple Summary

This SCCP proposes to increase the `issuanceRatio` ratio from 2.5% currently (i.e. 4000% cratio) to 10% (i.e. 1,000% cratio).

# Abstract

The issuance ratio is the ratio that determines the maximum amount of sUSD that can be minted for a staked amount of snx collateral.

# Motivation

The temporary increase in collateralization ratio was previously implemented in order to rollout [SIP-2059](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-2059), with the debt windfall benefiting stakers that took on the historical legacy debt from the long ETH skew. With sip-2059 being mostly rolled out, and changes being to the discount rate planned to be implemented in slow incremental steps, the issuanceRatio can be restored back to previous levels. This SCCP proposes to start off that process with, with gradual changes to the `issuanceRatio` being proposed to limit the impact on the protocol.
