# Simple Summary

This SCCP proposes to lower the exchange fee on sETH/sUSD on L1 and and L2 temporarily to zero, in coordination with the Treasury Council, in order to facilitate full unwind of the [sETH wrapper](https://etherscan.io/address/0xcea392596f1ab7f1d6f8f241967094ca519e6129) on the ethereum network:
- swap enough sUSD to sETH to unwind the sETH wrapper on L1
- unwrap the sETH on L1 by burning the sETH
- send the wETH to L2
- wrap the wETH to mint sETH
- swap the sETH back to sUSD
- send sUSD back to L1 (with 7 day delay)

# Abstract

The fee levers that need to be updated are as follows:
- on ethereum, `setAtomicExchangeFeeRate` would be used on `sETH` to update the fee to zero
- on optimism `setExchangeFeeRate` would be used on `sETH` to update the fee to zero
- on optimism `setExchangeDynamicFeeRounds` would be used on `sETH` to lower the number of rounds to 1 (effectively disabling dynamic fees)

# Motivation

The proposed changes in this SCCP is part of a suite of pre-requisite changes done, in order to facilitate migration of spot synths on L1 as specified in [SIP-2059](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-2059/) and unwinding of the debt pool skew.

Important to note that all parameters are restored back to previous levels following the full unwind of the sETH wrapper on L1.
