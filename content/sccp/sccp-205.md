## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the SCCP.-->

Increase the target staking ratio to 400% for snx stakers on ethereum and optimism.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the variable change proposed.-->

The target staking ratio, is the minimum collateralization ratio required for stakers to claim rewards. It also represents the maximum amount of debt a staker can inccur when minting sUSD.

## Motivation

<!--The motivation is critical for SCCPs that want to update variables within Synthetix. It should clearly explain why the existing variable is not incentive aligned. SCCP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->

The main motivation is the recent snx price action which is accompanied by the increase in snx price volatility. In order to protect the system from potentially significant liquidation when stakers mint max, a higher minimum staking ratio is needed. 
Over the long run, the target staking ratio should be stable as the snx price stabalizes at around a certain equilibrium market price.
The SCCP was rescinded by the author.
