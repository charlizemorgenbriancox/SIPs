# Simple Summary

This SCCP proposes to update the ETH wrapper parameter on Optimism to the following:
- `maxTokenAmount`: 2,000
- `mintFeeRate`: 0 bp
- `burnFeeRate`: 100 bp

# Abstract

- The `burnFeeRate` is a parameter that determines the fee to be paid in order to release the underlying, when a synth is burned
- The `mintFeeRate` is the rate that paid for locking up a certain underlying to mint it's respective synth equivalent.
- The `maxTokenAmount` is the max amount allowed to be used to issue a synth with a underlying specified in the wrapper contract, in this case it's LUSD.


# Motivation

The main motivation is to encourage more on-ramp of synth via the ETH wrapper in order to lean on the debt pool skew.
