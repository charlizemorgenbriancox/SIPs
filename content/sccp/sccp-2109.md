# Simple Summary

This SCCP proposes to lower the `maxTokenAmount` on the [wETH wrapper](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x6202a3b0be1d222971e93aab084c6e584c29db70) on optimism to zero from 2k ETH.

# Abstract

The `maxTokenAmount` is the maximum amount that can be wrapped at any point.

# Motivation 

The primary motivation is the abundance of synth liquidity on AMMs on both L1 and L2, making the excess wrapper capacity not necessary.
