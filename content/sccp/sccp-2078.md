# Simple Summary

This SCCP proposes to lower the XMR perp v2 `MaxMarketValue` parameter, from 5,000 to 1,000.

# Abstract

`maxMarketValue` represents the maximum open interest allowed on either the long side or the short side of the perp market.

# Motivation

The motivation is because of the recently announced delisting on centralized exchanges, resulting in skew arbitrage being more difficult.
