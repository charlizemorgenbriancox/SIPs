*Slippage refers to the price impact incurred from trading with a 100k$ notional*

## Fees

| **Market** | **Current** | **Proposed** | **Curve** |

# Abstract

Below is a description of the parameter changes proopsed in the SCCP:
- `skewScale` is the scaling factor of the relevant market in the underlying currency for computing PD and Funding Rates.
- `maker/taker` refer to the fees charged for opening a position that reduces / increase the skew with the help of the pyth offchain oracle.

# Motivation

The proposed parameter changes on skew scale aim at increasing the incentive on arbitrageurs to arbitrage the skew by targeting an effective liquidity comfortably below liquidity available on centralized exchanges. While the motivation behind the changes on the maker/taker fees related to the stETH/ETH market, is matching curve fees and lean against narrow short-term peg volatility.
