# Simple Summary

This SCCP proposes to increase the CRV market's max market value from 3m to 6m.

# Abstract

The maxMarketValue is the max market value of the relevant market in the underlying currency

# Motivation

The main motivation is the recent surge in off chain crv liquidity and [open interest](https://www.binance.com/en/futures/funding-history/perpetual/trading-data), which allows us to increase the limit and remain conservative in our configurations.
