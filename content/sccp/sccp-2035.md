## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the SCCP.-->

This SCCP proposes to apply the below DirectIntegration parameters on the new 1inch Cross-Asset Swap contract `0xbF683B7AAf9acCeA6bFf8E926e03f6cEB98b525a`:

```
{'currencyKey': 'sUSD',
 'dexPriceAggregator': '0x228bCc970003Ca7588337604AFD9Fc5d92bF1C8B',
 'atomicMaxVolumePerBlock': 15m$,
 'atomicExchangeFeeRate': 0}

{'currencyKey': 'sETH',
 'dexPriceAggregator': '0x228bCc970003Ca7588337604AFD9Fc5d92bF1C8B',
 'atomicMaxVolumePerBlock': 15m$,
 'atomicExchangeFeeRate': 5 bp}

{'currencyKey': 'sBTC',
 'dexPriceAggregator': '0x228bCc970003Ca7588337604AFD9Fc5d92bF1C8B',
 'atomicMaxVolumePerBlock': 15m$,
 'atomicExchangeFeeRate': 5 bp}
```

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the variable change proposed.-->

The DirectIntegration addresses are contracts setup by integrators, that are allowed to trade at specialized fees and parameters, given that they satisfy certain conditions. In 1inch's case, they abide going throught the fusion offering which incorporates around a block delay for filling an order which leads to fresh uniswap prices being used:

- dexPriceAggregator is the uniswap aggregator in operation, it would be pointed towards the uniswap 5 bp pools.
- atomicMaxVolumePerBlock is the maximum sUSD volume allowed per block.
- atomicExchangeFeeRate is the fee rate paid on exchanges into a specific synth.

## Motivation

<!--The motivation is critical for SCCPs that want to update variables within Synthetix. It should clearly explain why the existing variable is not incentive aligned. SCCP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->

The primary purpose is to switch over to the new 1inch address, as the old ones was deprecated.
