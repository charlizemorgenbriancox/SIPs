# Simple Summary
This SCCP proposes to reconfigure the issuance caps for sUSDe on Arbitrum.

# Abstract
The parameters configurations description is as follows:

- Maximum LP amount: $50M
- Issuance Ratio: 200%
- Liquidation Ratio: 105%

# Motivation

The Arbitrum deployment is ready to be configured for yield-generating collateral types as defined by [SIP-371](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-371/). Issuance must be raised for sUSDe (and USDe) to ensure risk is properly handled for sUSDe/USDe.
