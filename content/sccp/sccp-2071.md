# Simple Summary

This SCCP proposes to lower the `maxMarketValue` on the ENJ perp market to 0.

# Abstract

The `maxMarketValue` is the maximum size of the market (longs/shorts) that can be assumed at any point.

# Motivation

This parameter change is proposed because of the lack of proper price discovery on this market, with prices on centralized exchanges not being consistent with one another for a persistently prolonged period of time
