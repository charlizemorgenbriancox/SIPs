## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the SCCP.-->

This SCCP intends to improve the `PerpsV2` offering by decreasing the `offchainDelayedOrderMinAge` to 4 seconds (i.e. 2 blocks) and `offchainDelayedOrderMaxAge` to 60 seconds.
These changes can only be enacted subsequent to the bedrock release.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the variable change proposed.-->

- The `offchainDelayedOrderMinAge` represents the least amount of time that needs to elapse, since the order committment time, beore a delayed offchain order can be executed. 
- The `offchainDelayedOrderMaxAge` represents the longest amount of time that can elapse, since the order committment time, during which a positon can be executed. 

## Motivation

<!--The motivation is critical for SCCPs that want to update variables within Synthetix. It should clearly explain why the existing variable is not incentive aligned. SCCP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->
The primary motivation is to significantly improve the PerpsV2 user experience, by decreasing the amount of time needed for a delayed order to be executed and the amount of time needed to cancel a expired position.
