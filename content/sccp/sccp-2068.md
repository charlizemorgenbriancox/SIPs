# Simple Summary

This SCCP proposes to deprecate the v1 market configured under FuturesMarketManager.

# Motivation

The motivation behind this sccp is to decrease the gas required to fetch the  debt, which iterates on both the v1 and v2 markets, and allows us to list more markets on Perps V2. Aside from this benefit, these v1 markets have largely been shutdown as per [SCCP-278](https://sips.synthetix.io/sccp/sccp-278/), which was implemented as seen on [kwenta](https://v1.kwenta.eth.limo/dashboard/). However, having these legacy markets in the state, creates issues with debt cache which reports an `invalid` debt calculation, due to legacy v1 configurations which have long been outlived by the protocol (related to the `ExchangeRatesCircuitBreaker` and deprecation of synth exchanges exchanges). Therefore, deprecating these markets, removes any connections of the existing manager system to these deprecated markets while not have any impact on the existing v2 markets.
