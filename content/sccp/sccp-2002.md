# Simple Summary

This SCCP proposes to increase leverage on all crypto perps (including those mentioned in [SCCP-2000](https://sips.synthetix.io/sccp/sccp-2000/)) by 10%.

# Abstract

The `maxLeverage` is the maximum possible leverage to undertake on a given position.

# Motivation

The main motivation is to improve the ux, since between the time traders signal their intention to trade at max leverage, and the time the order actually gets executed, prices could move leading to a max leverage being exceeded revert and the order becoming stale in consequence.
