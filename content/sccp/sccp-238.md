## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the SCCP.-->

This SCCP proposes to increase the `maxMarketValueUSD` on the BTC futures market to 10m sUSD from 5m sUSD.


## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the variable change proposed.-->
The `maxMarketValueUSD` is the maximum amount of open interest allowed on each side of a market.

## Motivation

<!--The motivation is critical for SCCPs that want to update variables within Synthetix. It should clearly explain why the existing variable is not incentive aligned. SCCP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->

The primary motivation is the increase in oi utilization, which currently stands at around 90%.
