# Simple Summary

This SCCP proposes to update the parameters of the CRV Perp market as per the below:

## Skew Scale:

| **Current Scale** | **Proposed Scale** | **Current Slippage** | **Proposed Slippage** | **Cex Slippage** |
|:-----------------:|:------------------:|:--------------------:|:---------------------:|:----------------:|
|     37,500,000    |     46,875,000     |          47          |           38          |        13        |

** Slippage figures in the table above are with respect to a trade size of USD 500 thousand **

## Max Market Value
Increase the maxMarketValue from 1,851,900 CRV tokens to 6m CRV tokens (roughly 2m$)

# Abstract
