# Simple Summary

This SCCP to revert the changes implemented on [SCCP-2061](https://sips.synthetix.io/sccp/sccp-2061).

The SCCP also proposes to implement the following for the next 5 weeks, starting Saturday 2nd of December and ending on the 30th of December, between 15:00 UTC and 16:00 UTC:
1) Lower the `atomicMaxVolumePerBlock` to 250k sUSD
2) Lower the `atomicExchangeFeeRate` to 5 bp on sETH trades
3) Revert the parameters back to their original values 

# Abstract

Below is a description of the parameters that are proposed to be updated:
- The `exchangeFeeRate` is the fee rate applied on the amount being exchanged via conventional synth exchanges with fee reclamation. 
- The `atomicMaxVolumePerBlock` is maximum volume of trading via atomic swaps per block
- The `atomicExchangeFeeRate` is the fee rate applied on trades into a certain synth

# Motivation

The proposed parameter changes are meant to facilitate arbitrage of the peg between L1 and L2 and help guarantee the execution price of arbitrage.
