# Simple Summary

This SCCP proposes to lower the `maxMarketValue` parameter to zero on the MATIC market because of the [token swap](https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/binance-will-support-the-polygon-matic-token-swap-to-polygon-pol-6a6de383727f4659a3050f7982e1620f?hl=en) and as per oracle providers' recommendations. 
Furthermore, the market will be completely deprecated on the 5th of September and the remaining margin associated with that market sent to the treasury council to distribute to traders.

# Abstract
`maxMarketValue` determines the maximum open interest on the market, setting the parameter to zero effectively sets the market to close only.

# Motivation

The proposed change is in light of the recent token swap.
