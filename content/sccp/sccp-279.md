# Simple Summary

This SCCP proposes to increase the maxTokenAmount on the ETH wrapper from 15k ETH to 20k ETH.

# Abstract

The `maxTokenAmount` is the max amount allowed to be used to issue a synth with a underlying specified in the wrapper contract, in this case it's WETH.

# Motivation

The main motivation is to lean against the positive skew ETH on the debt pool, which is around 45%. It is worth noting that currently ETH and DAI wrappers are at full capacity on the ethereum network and the sUSD/sETH pegs at a slight premium. Note that if the 5K ETH get wrapped and sent to sUSD the skew would be lowered to around 40%.
