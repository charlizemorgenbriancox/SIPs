# Simple Summary

This SCCP proposes to lower the oi cap on CVX, XTZ and APE markets to zero. The SCCP also proposes to deprecate these markets once [SIP-2051](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-2051/) is implemented on the 31'st of July.   

# Abstract

`maxMarketValue` sets the open interest cap (longs & shorts) on the given market.

# Motivation

The primary motivation is the decrease in perp liquidity on centralized exchanges, as support is being dropped on these markets in particular due to the lack of trading activity.
