## Simple Summary

Lower fees on exchanges into sBTC, sETH, sLINK, sSOL, and sUSD from 40bp to 25bp on Optimism; and lower `exchangeDynamicFeeThreshold` to 25bp on Optimism. 

## Motivation

Analysis of on-chain data has shown that with the implementation of [SIP-184 for dynamic fees](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-184), lower base exchange fees are now feasible. 
This SCCP proposes to lower base exchange fees for sBTC, sETH, sLINK, sSOL, and sUSD to 25bp on Optimism, and also lower the dynamic fee parameter `exchangeDynamicFeeThreshold` to 25bp.
