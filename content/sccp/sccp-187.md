## Abstract

The `MaxMarketValueUSD` is the maximum amount of open interest available for a certain Futures Market.

## Motivation

<!--The motivation is critical for SCCPs that want to update variables within Synthetix. It should clearly explain why the existing variable is not incentive aligned. SCCP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->

The primary motivation to increase the open interest limit given the increased demand for sGOLD futures.
