# Simple Summary

This SCCP proposes to deprecate the FET perp market as described in [SIP-2068](https://sips.synthetix.io/sccp/sccp-2068/).

# Abstract

Dropping this market entails removing the market from the `FuturesMarketManager` contract.

# Motivation

The market oi cap was decreased to zero following [SCCP-2104](https://sips.synthetix.io/sccp/sccp-2104/) giving a chance to users to close their positions and remove their margin. However, an insignificant amount remains outstanding and it is recommended to dissociate this market from the system as per oracle providers' recommendations who are also expected to deprecate the feeds.
