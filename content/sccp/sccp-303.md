# Simple Summary

This SCCP proposes extending the length of governance epoch duration from three to four months, with council elections thereby occurring three times a year rather than quarterly.

# Abstract

The current length of governance epochs was set to three months with the passing of SCCP-78: Change Spartan Council Epoch to quarterly (3 months), with the members of the four councils (Spartan, Treasury, Grants and Ambassador) elected at the conclusion of March, June, September and December respectively. This SCCP proposes extending the epoch duration to four-month intervals, thereby occurring in December, April and August thereafter.

# Motivation

Individual members of the four councils have expressed the opinion that the three-month epochs can hamper the smooth arrangement and management of ongoing protocol initiatives (partnership negotiations, integration activities, business endeavours, etc.). What is more, especially during a time of market downturn, voter fatigue can occur among token holders, a factor which can hinder the effectiveness of council elections in securing optimal candidates. For these reasons, plus the ongoing efforts to facilitate council member replacement mid-epoch (where necessary) this SCCP seeks to transition to four-month epochs, establishing greater council and, by extension, project stability.
