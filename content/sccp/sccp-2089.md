# Simple Summary

This SCCP proposes to update the `issueFeeRate` on loans to 40% from 1%

# Abstract

`issueFeeRate` is the rate charged on drawing down on existing loans

# Motivation

Despite the recent parameter changes, loans are still being tapped in order to draw out sUSD liquidity which leans on monetary policy changes that aim to control the debt pool skew. The parameter change proposed in this SCCP significantly discourages more sUSD liquidity being drawn out from legacy loans.
