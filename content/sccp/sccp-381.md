## Simple Summary

This SCCP proposes to lower the oi caps on the FTM market to zero.

## Abstract

The cap can be lowered by reducing the `maxMarketValue` and `maxMarketSize` to zero.

## Motivation

Given the token swap and rebrand to [sonic](https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/binance-will-support-the-fantom-ftm-token-swap-and-rebranding-to-sonic-s-aec6fcbc84b749eeab6690e6bcac2f3d) and as oracle providers switch over to new feeds, it is necessary to deprecate these markets by switching the caps to zero (close only).
