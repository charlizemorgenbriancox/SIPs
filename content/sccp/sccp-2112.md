# Simple Summary

This SCCP proposes to decrease the dynamic redeemer discount rate to 50% from 60%.

# Abstract

`discountRate` as per [SIP-2059](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-2059/), is used to compute the value of the debt pool. It also determines the price at which a user can redeem his outstanding spot synths. 

# Motivation

The primary motivation is to move forward the intention of [SIP-2059](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-2059/), increasing the incentives on users to migrate their synths over into sUSD.
