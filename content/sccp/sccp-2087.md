# Simple Summary

This SCCP proposes to lower the LUSD wrapper `maxTokenAmount` back to zero.

# Abstract

The `maxTokenAmount` is the max amount allowed to be used to issue a synth with a underlying specified in the wrapper contract, in this case it's LUSD.

# Motivation

The main motivation is to lean on the sETH skew by encouraging more on-ramp via the `ETH > sETH > sUSD` route.
