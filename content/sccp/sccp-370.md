# Simple Summary

This SCCP proposes to deploy the below markets on Perps V3 on Base and Arbitrum:

| **Market** | **minimumInitialMarginRatio** | **initialMarginRatio** | **maintenanceMarginScalar** | **skewScale** | **maxMarketSize** | **maxMarketValue** |
|:----------:|:-----------------------------:|:----------------------:|:---------------------------:|:-------------:|:-----------------:|:------------------:|
|     CAT    |               5%              |          0.449         |            0.335            |  100 billion  |    50 trillion    |         2m         |
|    DEGEN   |               5%              |          0.658         |            0.317            |  100 million  |    600 million    |         1m         |
|    SLERF   |               5%              |          1.073         |            0.317            |    5 million  |     15 million    |        500k        |

Aside from the above parameters , the perps markets will have the following configurations as well:
- TakerFeeRatio: 10 bp 
- MakerFeeRatio: 0 bp
- maxFundingVelocity: 9
- flagRewardRatio: 3 bp
- minimumPositionMargin: 50
- lockedOiRatio: 0.5 
- maxLiquidationLimitMultiplier: 1.5
- maxLiquidationPD: 5 bp
- endorsedLiquidator: "0x11233749514Ab8d00C0A5873DF7428b3db70030f"


# Abstract

The parameters configurations description is as follows:
- initialMarginRatio is a scalar applied on the minimumInitialMarginRatio to determine the minimum initial margin required to support a given portfolio of positions
- maintenanceMarginScalar is a scalar applied on the initialMargin in order to obtain the maintenanceMargin. When traders fall below the maintenance margin, they are liquidated.
- skewScale is the scaling factor of the relevant market in the underlying currency for computing price impact and funding rates
- maxMarketSize is the max market value of the relevant market in the underlying currency
- maxMarketValue is the max market value of the relevant market in USD
- maker/taker fees pertain to fees charged when trading
- maxFundingVelocity is the main parameter that allows to nudge funding rates
- minimumPositionMargin is the minimum margin required
- lockedOiRatio is the multiplier that determines the minimum amount of perp collateral required to back a given perp market
- maxLiquidationLimitMultiplier is a parameter that rate limits liquidations. It is applied on the sum of maker and taker fees with a liquidation rate limit being triggered if pd exceeds that value
- maxLiquidationPD is the minimum pd that triggers a reset of the liquidation capacity
- endorsedLiquidator is a liquidator address that can bypass the rate limit
- the collateral liquidation penalty is the penalty paid to the liquidator for executing a liquidation


# Motivation

The more options traders have via Synthetix Perps, the less likely they will move their margin to other trading venues to trade markets we don't provide.
