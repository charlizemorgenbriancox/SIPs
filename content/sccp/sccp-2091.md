## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the SCCP.-->

Lower the c-ratio to 400%.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the variable change proposed.-->

Lowering the c-ratio to 400% will increase the capital efficiency of the network.

## Motivation

<!--The motivation is critical for SCCPs that want to update variables within Synthetix. It should clearly explain why the existing variable is not incentive aligned. SCCP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->

The c-ratio was raised during the bear market to prevent liquidations. Given the shift to a bull market, increasing capital efficiency is important to compete with other staking options.
