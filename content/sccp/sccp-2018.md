# Simple Summary

This SCCP proposes to update the following parameters:
- Double the PEPE max market value to 2.4 trillion from 1.2 trillion previously (i.e. to 4m$)
- Double the BNB max market value to 40k from 20k (i.e. to 9.5m$)
- Lower the skewScale on PEPE to 30 trillion from 37 trillion

# Abstract

Below is a description of the parameter being changed:
- `maxMarketValue` is the maximum amount of open interest allowed on long and short positions in a given perp market.
- `skewScale` is a scaling parameter that helps calibrate the amount of slippage (or price improvement) a position receives when a position is modified. It also is a parameter that affects the speed by which funding rate changes.

# Motivation

The motivation behind these changes are as follows:
- PEPE and BNB having high utilization, which exceeds 75%, would benefit from the `maxMarketValue` increase. It is worth noting that the open interest exposure on synthetix's side is far below that available on other trading venues, so the changes denoted in this SCCP are still fairly conservative.
- Lowering the skewScale parameter on PEPE, helps incentivize large volume arbitrages that neutralize a skew, taking into account the slippage incurred on other trading venues.
