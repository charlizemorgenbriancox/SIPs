# Simple Summary

This SCCP proposes to increase the offchain price divergence on PEPE market from 2% to 5%.

# Abstract

Below is a description of the parameter being changed:
- `offchainPriceDivergence` is the maximum divergence allowed between chainlink and pyth for an order to execute.

# Motivation

The primary motivation is volatility of the PEPE market, which is causing slight delay in prices between the two feeds to be aligned. This change will alleviate these issues while keeping the check on pyth price not drifting away too far from chainlink prices.
