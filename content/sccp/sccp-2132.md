## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the SCCP.-->

Lower the target c-ratio to 250%

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the variable change proposed.-->

This SCCP changes the target c-ratio from 500% to 250%

## Motivation

<!--The motivation is critical for SCCPs that want to update variables within Synthetix. It should clearly explain why the existing variable is not incentive aligned. SCCP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->

With the SNX price below $2, a c-ratio of 500% puts undue pressure on stakers, and inhibits their ability to burn back to target to remove a liquidation flag. This SCCP reduces the target c-ratio back to 250% where it should remain until price volatility has decreased, and the price of SNX is above $3 for at least several weeks. Stability of the c-ratio is critical for stakers to make informed decisions about their staking strategy. This SCCP should provide confidence to stakers that the ratio will remain at 250% until SNX recovers and price volatility declines.
