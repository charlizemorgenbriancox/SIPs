title: Increase Issuance Ratios for LP Assets on Arbitrum

# Simple Summary

This SCCP proposes to increase demand for the USDx Stablecoin on Arbitrum by increasing issuance ratios to 1000% for all LP assets.

# Motivation

The primary motivation for this SCCP is to increase demand for USDx on Arbitrum, ensuring that users can enter and exit Perps V3 on Arbitrum. Currently, there is a large outstanding supply (due to low issuance ratios and 0% interest) without corresponding demand, as Perps V3 hasn't launched yet.

Once demand increases, utilizing existing stable wrappers will provide further support for the USDx peg when demand outstrips supply.

Note: Increasing issuance ratios does not affect liquidation risk for existing borrowers. Liquidation ratios will remain exactly the same.
