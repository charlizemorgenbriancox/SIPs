# Simple Summary

This SCCP proposes to update the USDT perps v2 parameters as per the below:
- `maxPD` updated from 15 bp to 30 bp
- `maxLiquidationDelta` update from 30 bp to 15 bp

# Abstract

maxPD (MPD) and maxLiquidationDelta (MLD) are parameters introduced in [SIP-2005](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-2005/) and are set by governance taking into account the below rules:
- maxPD is set to 2 * (offchain maker fee + offchain taker fee)
- maxLiquidationDelta is set to offchain maker + offchain taker fees
These parameters did not respect the best practive rule of thumb which has been rolled out on all existing perp markets which could result in more relinance on endorsed liquidations then necessary without having any effect on the trading experience.

# Motivation

The main motivation is to align the `maxPD` and `maxLiquidationDelta` parameters as per the rules of thumb established on all markets.
