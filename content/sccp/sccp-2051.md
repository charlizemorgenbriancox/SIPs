# Simple Summary

This SCCP proposes to boost L2's rewards by `130,178` snx during the minting week starting the 16th of October and reverting that increase back to its original state in the subsequent week.

# Abstract

The following contract calls would be invoked in order to temporarily boost rewards for L2 stakers:
- `RewardsDistribution.editRewardDistribution` permits the configuration of the snx distribution to l2 stakers from the weekly mint.
- `SupplySchedule.setInflationAmount` permits the configuration of the weekly inflation mint amount.

# Motivation

The main motivation is to compensate L2 stakers for the missed inflationary rewards during the week of the 9th of October. This was due to an insufficient gas reversion [L1 minting transaction](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x9db69f2f9d9782e003eae79da083088355d2729a123e3897bf5a3f1a46072832) in the weekly inflation print transaction. A more holistic fix would be proposed in [sip-2036](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-2036) that aims at preventing a similar situation from occurring.
