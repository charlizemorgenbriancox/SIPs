# Simple Summary

This SCCP proposes to decrease the `exchangeDynamicFeeRounds` on sETH to 1

# Abstract

Decreasing the `exchangeDynamicFeeRounds` to 1 effectively disabled the dynamic fee rate on swaps to sETH

# Motivation

In order to encourage more on-ramp of sUSD via the `ETH > sETH > sUSD`, friction can be alleviated with the parameter change proposed in this sccp.
