<!--You can leave these HTML comments in your merged SCCP and delete the visible duplicate text guides, they will not appear and may be helpful to refer to if you edit it again. This is the suggested template for new SCCPs. Note that an SCCP number will be assigned by an editor. When opening a pull request to submit your SCCP, please use an abbreviated title in the filename, `sccp-draft_title_abbrev.md`. The title should be 44 characters or less.-->

## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the SCCP.-->

In preparation of allowing permissionless account migration from V2x to V3 on the ethereum network, and the full implementation of [SIP-306](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-306/), this SCCP proposes the following:
- Disable account merge on Ethereum and Optimism
- Disable issuance on Ethereum, by lowering the `issuanceRatio` to 1 wei
- Disable debt migration

Note that the changes would be only implemented when the legacy market migration is fully launched.

## Motivation

<!--The motivation is critical for SCCPs that want to update variables within Synthetix. It should clearly explain why the existing variable is not incentive aligned. SCCP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->

The changes required in order to ensure the smooth rollout of the permissionless migration functionality, allowing v2X staking accounts to move to the V3 Core System.
