# Simple Summary

This SCCP proposes to lower the DYDX perp v2 `MaxMarketValue` parameter, to 318,000 (1m$) from 1.9m (~6m$).

# Abstract

`maxMarketValue` represents the maximum open interest allowed on either the long side or the short side of the perp market.

# Motivation

The motivation is because of the on-going [token migration](https://docs.dydx.community/dydx-token-migration/start-here/introduction) that could cause price discrepancies between oracle providers.
