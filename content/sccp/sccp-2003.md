# Simple Summary

This SCCP proposes to implement the following:
- Decrease all the perp market `maxMarketValue` parameters to zero, on the 4th of June at 16:00 UTC and to restore the open interest limits back to their previous levels after [bedrock](https://oplabs.notion.site/Bedrock-Mission-Control-EXTERNAL-fca344b1f799447cb1bcf3aae62157c5) update is completed.
- Set all the perp markets to a paused state, 10 minutes before the bedrock update is set to begin, and restore markets back to activity shortly after bedrock release is finalized.

# Abstract

The `maxMarketValue` is the maximum amount of open interest allowed on long and short positions in a given perp market.

# Motivation

The main motivation is to decrease the exposure of the debt pool to open positions, especially that the bedrock update is expected to result in 2 to 4 hours of downtime.
