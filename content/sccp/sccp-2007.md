## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the SCCP.-->

Disallowing new shorts from being opened by setting the `canOpen` variable to 0.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the variable change proposed.-->

- The `setCanOpen` function allows to disable new shorts from being opened.


## Motivation

<!--The motivation is critical for SCCPs that want to update variables within Synthetix. It should clearly explain why the existing variable is not incentive aligned. SCCP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->

Loans and shorts were set to be deprecated, [SIP-273](https://sips.synthetix.io/sccp/sccp-273/) and [SCCP-146](https://sips.synthetix.io/sccp/sccp-146/). However, the shorting contracts were kept active to accord Lyra time to prepare for the transition towards Perps. With Lyra now set to tap into [perps](https://snapshot.org/#/lyra.eth/proposal/0x89bc59e634a54d75fb56710bd2804dc19acd707655700fee11ebf899f54d92bb) and having closed their existing short positions the product can be safely be prepared for sunset by disabling ability of accounts from opening new shorts.
