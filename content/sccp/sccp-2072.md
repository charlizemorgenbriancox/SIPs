# Simple Summary

This SCCP proposes to lower the `maxMarketValue` on the TRB perp market to 0.

# Abstract

The `maxMarketValue` is the maximum size of the market (longs/shorts) that can be assumed at any point.

# Motivation

This parameter change is proposed because of the lack of proper arbitrage on this market with respect to the PERP market counterpart.
