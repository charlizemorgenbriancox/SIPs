# Simple Summary

This SCCP proposes to create a USDe Wrapper on optimism with 0 fees and 10 million capacity.

# Abstract

The wrapper will be created with the `createWrapper` function on the [WrapperFactory](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x27be2EFAd45DeBd732C1EBf5C9F7b49D498D4a93#code)  with the following arguments:
- token: `0x5d3a1Ff2b6BAb83b63cd9AD0787074081a52ef34`
- currencyKey: `0x7355534400000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000`
- synthContractName: `0x53796e7468735553440000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000`

# Motivation

The proposed wrapper is in light of recent limitations on increasing the capacity of the sUSD from L1 to L2, without making changes to the DebtCache contract. This along with the increased demand for sUSD liquidity calls for the usage USDe which allows for instant bridging between ethereum and optimism via the [stargate bridge](https://stargate.finance/).
