# Simple Summary

This SCCP proposes to increase the max number of positions per account from 3 to 4.

# Abstract

The max number of perp positions per account limits is a limitation put in place in order to limit the gas consumption per trade settle. With [SCCP-325](https://sips.synthetix.io/sccp/sccp-325/) in place, the cap can be lifted with no issue on the keeper compensation.

# Motivation

The motivation is to improve the user experience by allowing more positions to be opened per single account
