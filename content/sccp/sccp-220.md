## Simple Summary

A proposal to revert SCCP-216 parameter changes for Optimism. 

## Abstract

This proposal aims to revert parameters for Optimism to the state they were in before SCCP-216 execution.

Specifically, this SCCP proposes decreasing the target c-ratio from 400% to 350% and increasing the liquidation ratio from 145% to 150%.


## Motivation

SCCP-216 increased the c-ratio from 350% to 400% and decreased the liquidation ratio from 150% to 145%. These parameter changes were intended only for Ethereum. However, both Ethereum and Optimism parameters were changed.

This SCCP reverts the parameter changes for Optimism, as those changes were not the intent of SCCP-216.
