## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed change intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposal intends to achieve. This should be accessible to a casual community member.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what _will_ be done if the SR is implemented, not _why_ it should be done or _how_ it will be done.-->

A short (~200 word) description of the proposal, the abstract should clearly describe the proposal. This is what _will_ be done if the SR is implemented, not _why_ it should be done or _how_ it will be done.

## Motivation

<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the SR. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the SR proposes changing how Synthetix operates, you must address _why_ the current methods of operation appear inadequate. This is not the place to describe how the SR will address the issue!-->

## Specification

<!--The specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature, there are three sections
1. Overview
2. Rationale
3. Specification
-->

### Overview

<!--This is a high level overview of *how* the SR will solve the problem. The overview should clearly describe how the new suggested changes will be implemented.-->

This is a high level overview of _how_ the SR will solve the problem. The overview should clearly describe how the new suggested changes will be implemented.

### Rationale

<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose these changes – what were the considerations. The rationale fleshes out the motivation and reasoning behind decisions that were made. It should describe any alternate ideas that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

### Specification

<!--The specification should outline the changes being proposed to the operations, structure or design of Synthetix. For example, changes to any operations of working, changes to governance, changes to the tokenomics, etc.-->
