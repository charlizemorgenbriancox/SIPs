## Simple Summary

List DOGE-PERP, AVAX-PERP, OP-PERP, ORDI-PERP, and PERP-PERP on Perps v3 on the Base network.

## Abstract

List DOGE-PERP, AVAX-PERP, OP-PERP, ORDI-PERP, and PERP-PERP markets on Perps v3 on the Base network, expanding the range of v3 markets to include five additional markets. These markets are the highest volume markets on Perps v2 on Optimism which have yet to be listed on Perps v3 on Base. 

## Motivation

Now that LP caps have been raised to $21.92M, we should start introducing markets which are successful in the v2 system on Optimsim into the v3 system on Base. As of April 8, these are markets with the highest 24H trading volume on Perps v2.

## Specification

### Rationale

As we start to include more existing v2 markets in v3, it makes sense to start with some of the highest volume markets, as users have indicated that they want to trade these markets. Since all of these markets already exist in v2, it should be straightforward to approve and implement these additional markets in v3.

### Technical Specification

- Requires a Pyth oracle on Base for each market.

### Test Cases

- n/a

### Configurable Values

- To be set via SCCP for each market.
