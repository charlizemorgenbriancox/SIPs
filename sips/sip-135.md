## Simple Summary

Deploy sUSD shorts for sETH and sBTC onto L2.

### Overview

Refactor and optimise the L1 shorting mechanism to be deployable on Optimism.

### Rationale

There is currently no plan to deploy iSynths onto L2. This means that L2 users will not be able to access inverse price exposure. The shorting mechanism on L1 has proved successful, with around $50m of open interest. However, transactions are expensive, making the mechanism unviable for smaller trades.

Deploying this mechanism onto L2 will solve both of the above problems.

### Technical Specification

The mechanism for shorting is described in [SIP 103](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-103). The majority of work in this SIP is around reducing code size to conform with OVM requirements.

It also proposes some improvements to the UX. Depositing and withdrawing collateral are not subject to an interaction delay. This allows users to combine these functions with a call to draw/repay. Liquidations are also not subject to an interaction delay.

Shorts can be repaid with the underlying collateral, to prevent the user from having to purchase the shorted asset.

The interface will look like this:

```solidity
function open(uint collateral, uint amount, bytes32 currency) external returns (uint id);

function close(uint id) external;

function deposit(address borrower, uint id, uint amount) external;

function withdraw(uint id, uint amount) external;

function repay(uint id, uint amount, bool repayWithCollateral) external;

function draw(uint id, uint amount) external;

function liquidate(address borrower, uint id, uint amount) external;
```

The interaction delay will be set to 0 initially. In the event that frontrunning becomes an issue, it can be increased by SCCP.

### Test Cases

Unit tests included with implementation.

### Configurable Values (Via SCCP)

Adding shorting against other synth assets beyond just sETH and sBTC. Will be proposed via an SCCP.
