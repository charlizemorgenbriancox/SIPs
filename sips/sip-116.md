## Simple Summary
<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->
Optimism is defining a new standard for deposit/withdrawal bridges between L1 and L2. This standard defines the function names and signatures for depositing tokens into L2, as well as for withdrawing them back to L1. We should consider updating our contracts to adopt this new standard.

## Abstract
<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the SIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the SIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->
The proposed changes involve renaming a few functions and events in two of our contracts as well as adding minor functionality to them to be able to deposit and withdraw SNX for another address. The contracts will need to be redeployed, and `SynthetixBridgeToOptimism`'s SNX balance will need to be migrated to the newly deployed L1 bridge contract.

## Motivation
<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the SIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the SIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is inaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the SIP will address the issue!-->
As Optimism's L2 gains adoption, more and more tokens will begin to move across the layers. One example of this is the official WETH token to be used in place of ETH in Optimism's mainnet, which will comply to the deposit/withdrawal interface standard. Unless these changes are applied, Synthetix's bridges will need to be interacted with in a different way to all the other bridges. Another reason to migrate now is that a migration in the future would involve moving a larget value of SNX.

## Specification
<!--The specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature, there are five sections
1. Overview
2. Rationale
3. Technical Specification
4. Test Cases
5. Configurable Values
-->

### Overview
<!--This is a high level overview of *how* the SIP will solve the problem. The overview should clearly describe how the new feature will be implemented.-->
The sources for the L1 and L2 bridges, namely `SynthetixBridgeToOptimism` and `SynthetixBridgeToBase`, will be updated to conform to the new interface. The new code will need to be deployed, and the SNX deposits currently held in the `SynthetixBridgeToOptimism` contract will need to be migrated to the new `SynthetixBridgeToOptimism` contract.

### Rationale
<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs. The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->
First, changes should be made to `SynthetixBridgeToOptimism` and `SynthetixBridgeToBase`. Following that, the corresponding test cases should be updated, and tests should be written to cover any new functionality.

The two contracts should be deployed on each layer and linked to their corresponding Synthetix instance. Migrating the SNX deposited in `SynthetixBridgeToOptimism` is not only a delicate operation since the contract holds a lot of value, but an asynchronicity problem between L1 and L2 regarding withdrawals needs to be addressed.

Withdrawals that were initiated in the original `SynthetixBridgeToBase` up to 7 days before the migration will effectively fail if deposited SNX is migrated immediately, because by the time they are ready to be finalized on the original `SynthetixBridgeToOptimism`, the contract will no longer be holding the SNX required for the withdrawal. In fact, it would not be holding any SNX at all.

Figure 1 - Asynchronous problems with withdrawals during the migration

As you can see in the diagram, withdrawals initiated on the v1 bridge will not be able to finalize, because the bridge will not have the necessary SNX funds required, since the funds were migrated to the v2 bridge at a previous point in time.

The diagram is also useful to illustrate how the 5 minute deposit window is not likely to be affected by this as long as the system is suspended for 5 minutes before the migration is executed.

Deposit finalization can be tracked using the [OΞ Transaction Tracker](http://optimism-snx-tracker.surge.sh/?token=SNX).

We can also see that withdrawals initiated in the v2 bridge, after the migration, should also not have any problems.

A naive solution would be to suspend withdrawals for 7 days before the migration:

Figure 2 - Naive solution

This is of course less than ideal, since we should try to achieve no withdrawal downtime. In fact, this is possible, and can be achieved by deploying the new bridges and migrating the SNX funds at a later time, when all withdrawals initiated in the v1 bridge have finalized.

Withdrawal finalization can be tracked using the OΞ Transaction Tracker.

### Technical Specification
<!--The technical specification should outline the public API of the changes proposed. That is, changes to any of the interfaces Synthetix currently exposes or the creations of new ones.-->

`SynthetixBridgeToOptimism` should adopt [`iOVM_L1ERC20Gateway`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/contracts/blob/master/contracts/optimistic-ethereum/iOVM/bridge/tokens/iOVM_L1ERC20Gateway.sol):
```solidity
interface iOVM_L1ERC20Gateway {
    function deposit(uint _amount) external;

    function depositTo(address _to, uint _amount) external;

    function finalizeWithdrawal(address _to, uint _amount) external;

    event DepositInitiated(address indexed _from, address _to, uint256 _amount);

    event WithdrawalFinalized(address indexed _to, uint256 _amount);
}
```

`SynthetixBridgeToBase` should adopt [`iOVM_L2DepositedERC20`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/contracts/blob/master/contracts/optimistic-ethereum/iOVM/bridge/tokens/iOVM_L2DepositedERC20.sol):
```solidity
interface iOVM_L2DepositedERC20 is IUniswapV2ERC20 {
    function withdraw(uint _amount) external;

    function withdrawTo(address _to, uint _amount) external;

    function finalizeDeposit(address _to, uint _amount) external;

    event WithdrawalInitiated(address indexed _from, address _to, uint256 _amount);

    event DepositFinalized(address indexed _to, uint256 _amount);
}
```

The bridges should implement these interfaces, as well as the previously existing `ISynthetixBridgeToOptimism` and `ISynthetixBridgeToBase` interfaces.

The new interface for `SynthetixBridgeToOptimism` should be:
```solidity
interface ISynthetixBridgeToOptimism {
    function migrateEscrow(uint256[][] calldata entryIDs) external;

    function depositReward(uint amount) external;

    function depositAndMigrateEscrow(uint256 depositAmount, uint256[][] calldata entryIDs) external;
}
```

The new interface for `SynthetixBridgeToBase` should be:
```solidity
interface ISynthetixBridgeToBase {
    function finalizeEscrowMigration(
        address account,
        uint256 escrowedAmount,
        VestingEntries.VestingEntry[] calldata vestingEntries
    ) external;

    function finalizeRewardDeposit(uint amount) external;
}
```

`SynthetixBridgeToOptimism`'s SNX balance will need to be migrated to the new `SynthetixBridgeToOptimism` contract, which will be achieved by calling the following function in the old contract:

`migrateBridge(address newBridge)` (https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix/blob/develop/contracts/SynthetixBridgeToOptimism.sol#L139).

When calling this function a script will be used, making a series of validations before the actual transaction is made, checking things like:
* That the new bridge address is valid
* That the new bridge address is a contract
* That the new bridge owner is the same as the old one
* That the old bridge balance is not zero
* That the new bridge balance is zero

Before deploying the new bridge, the system should be suspended for ~10m to ensure all deposits are finalized. When this is confirmed, the new bridge contracts can be deployed and connected.

Immediately after the new bridge contracts are active, withdrawals initiated from the old bridge should be monitored, and as soon as they are all finalized, `migrateBridge` can be called. This will ensure that withdrawals initiated in the new bridges will be finalized correctly from this point on.

### Test Cases
<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for SIPs but can be included with the implementation..-->
All existing tests will be renamed accordingly.

New test cases:

* `depositTo(address to, uint256 amount)`
	* Same as `deposit(uint256 amount)` amount, with
	* `msg.sender` is account1
	* `to` is account2
	* `amount` is deduced from account1's balance in L1
	* `amount` is minted for account2 on L2

* `withdrawTo(address to, uint256 amount)`
	* Same as `withdraw(uint256 amount)` amount, with
	* `msg.sender` is account1
	* `to` is account2
	* `amount` is deduced from account1's balance in L2
	* `amount` is released for account2 on L1

Migration simulation:

The migration, as described in this section and illustrated in figure 3, is simulated locally using the optimism integration tool (https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism-integration) with a `FRAUD_PROOF_WINDOW_SECONDS` of 120 seconds in a new test that can be found at `test/migrate-bridge` and ran with `npm run test:migrate-bridge`.

### Configurable Values (Via SCCP)
<!--Please list all values configurable via SCCP under this implementation.-->
No new configurable values are involved with the proposed changes.
