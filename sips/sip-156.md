## Simple Summary
<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->
This SIP proposes to replace the existing debt cache mechanism with a debt pool oracle operated by Chainlink. The current debt cache mechanism has the benefit of being entirely on-chain, however, it introduces significant complexity to the protocol. By replacing it with a Chainlink oracle we will simplify many functions within Synthetix and reduce gas costs, as well as introducing more scalability to the number of Synths the protocol can support.

## Abstract
<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the SIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the SIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->
This SIP will deprecate the existing debt cache mechanism described in (SIP-91)[https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-91] in favour of an Oracle that reads the composition of Synths in the debt pool, then calculates the total debt size off-chain and pushes it on-chain via a Chainlink aggregation contract.

## Motivation
<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the SIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the SIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is innaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the SIP will address the issue!-->
The current debt cache, while an extremely elegant solution to the problem of calculating the size of the debt pool for use by the minting and burning functions has a number of limitations. The primary limitation driving this proposed change is the upcoming need to unify the debt pools across L1 and L2. This requirement would mean that cross chain messaging would need to be enabled and would introduce further complexity to the implementation. Moving this functionality off-chain will allow for a more scalabile network as the number of Synths that can comprise the debt pool will no longer be limited by on-chain computational resources.

## Specification
<!--The specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature, there are five sections
1. Overview
2. Rationale
3. Technical Specification
4. Test Cases
5. Configurable Values
-->

### Overview
<!--This is a high level overview of *how* the SIP will solve the problem. The overview should clearly describe how the new feature will be implemented.-->
1. Implement new interfaces on all Synths and loans to allow the oracle to read and calculate the skew of each Synth
2. Replace the function to read the debt cache with a new function to read the latest debt oracle value
3. Add a function to minting and burning that tracks the incremental debt since the last debt oracle round id
4. Add functinality to track and compare the round id and net off the incremental debt if the debt oracle round id is greater than the last mint/burn round id
5. At the time of deployment increment the debt register of both debt pools with the additional debt to ensure that the debt percentages of stakers relfects the merged debt pools.

### Rationale
<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs. The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->
We initially contemplated extending the current debt cache mechanism to support cross network messaging as well as making a number of other iterative improvements to the calculations, however, after reviewing the implementation effort compared to performing these calculations off-chain we believed that an Oracle was the optimal solution. While an oracle increases the reliance on off-chain data aggregation, the fact that this data is being reasd on-chain and then processed reduces some of the failure modes and therefore risk to this change. It is also possible to make changes to the interfaces at a contract level that feedb up to the oracle to ensure that there are no modifications to the oracle logic to support new protocol functionality. 

### Technical Specification
<!--The technical specification should outline the public API of the changes proposed. That is, changes to any of the interfaces Synthetix currently exposes or the creations of new ones.-->
