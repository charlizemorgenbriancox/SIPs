<!--You can leave these HTML comments in your merged SIP and delete the visible duplicate text guides, they will not appear and may be helpful to refer to if you edit it again. This is the suggested template for new SIPs. Note that an SIP number will be assigned by an editor. When opening a pull request to submit your SIP, please use an abbreviated title in the filename, `sip-draft_title_abbrev.md`. The title should be 44 characters or less.-->

## Simple Summary
<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

Add a new long synth for Dogecoin (DOGE).

## Abstract
<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the SIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the SIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

Dogecoin has risen to a top 10 spot in the crypto market, and now boasts very high volume on centralized exchanges, in the multi-billions per day on average. With an sDOGE synth, Synthetix can capture a sizeable share of that market, generating more fees for the Synthetix protocol. The synth would pair nicely with renDOGE, a 1:1 Dogecoin token on Ethereum backed 1:1 by the Ren project, enabling highly liquid cross-pool synth swaps.


## Motivation
<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the SIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the SIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is innaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the SIP will address the issue!-->

Adding a DOGE synth could bring considerable volume to the Synthetix protocol, particularly as it pairs well with renDOGE token, enabling synthswaps. sDOGE provides a unique on-chain offering for traders looking to get exposure on DOGE because of its high volatility  and memability.


## Specification
<!--The specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature, there are five sections
1. Overview
2. Rationale
3. Technical Specification
4. Test Cases
5. Configurable Values
-->

### Overview
<!--This is a high level overview of *how* the SIP will solve the problem. The overview should clearly describe how the new feature will be implemented.-->
The Synth will be implemented in the same way as other crypto Synths.

### Rationale
<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs. The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->
The rationale for proposing Dogecoin above other assets is partly because it has risen to the top 10 in the crypto market, with considerable volume clocking in on an average of $3 billion in USD daily on Binance alone, and partly because there exists a permissionless bridge by the Ren project from Dogecoin to Ethereum, allowing anyone anytime to wrap Dogecoin into renDOGE 1:1, and allow anyone to redeem renDOGE to native DOGE 1:1. Through cross-pool synthswap, anyone could then go from native DOGE to BTC/ETH/USD/SNX with very little slippage.

### Liquidity Analysis

The tables below showcase statistics on the cost of pushing the price of DOGE on binance (on the DOGEUSDT pair) by the percentage mentioned in the header (denoted in bp):

 Bad actors in the space would need a signficant amount of capital in order to have a substantial impact on the price, therefore from a liquidity standpoint, DOGE appears to maintain reasonable amounts of liquidity on CEX. In addition, the average bid/ask spread is around 5 bp which is considered to be approporiate.
