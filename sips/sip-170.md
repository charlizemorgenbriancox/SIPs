## Simple Summary
This SIP proposes to divert the 25,000 SNX weekly incentives for L2 from the pDAO (being funded by the sDAO), to instead come from the inflationary SNX supply.

## Abstract
This SIP will change the funding source of the 25,000 weekly incentives for L2 from the sDAO (via the pDAO) to the inflationary supply of the SNX.

## Motivation
To move the weekly L2 incentives to come from the inflationary supply and away from the short term interim solution that was the sDAO (via the pDAO).

### Rationale
To use the intended inflationary supply for these SNX incentives. 

### Technical Specification
The SynthetixBridgeToOptimism contract can be added as a RewardsDistribution.addDistribution() recipient as it implements notifyRewardAmount.

### Test Cases
<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for SIPs but can be included with the implementation..-->

### Configurable Values (Via SCCP)
