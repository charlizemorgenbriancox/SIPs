## Simple Summary

Proposal to create a DAO to choose how to disburse funding for community grants. 

## Abstract

We'll set up a contract with 5 signers to vet grant proposals to contribute to the Synthetix community. This will represent the first, transitional phase of Synthetix's shift to decentralised governance. 

## Motivation

Community grants are currently disbursed by the Foundation. However, moving this process to a DAO will add transparency to the grants decision-making as well as providing invaluable data around how to coordinate future Synthetix DAOs. 

## Specification

There will be 5 signers, and for a grant to pass and receive funding it will require 4 approvals. 
If the community reaches negative consensus around a signer's performance, they can vote to replace that signer. 

## Rationale

This is a relatively light-touch way to ensure that strong, community-weighted consensus can be measured through the group of signers. 

## Test Cases

_To be added_

## Implementation

We have already engaged a team to build this contract.
