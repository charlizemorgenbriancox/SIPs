## Simple Summary

Proposal to move Synthetix contracts owner to a Gnosis multisig wallet. 

## Abstract

Currently the contract owner is a single wallet. This decision was made to allow Synthetix to iterate quickly on team and community-led initiatives. We propose increasing security by shifting ownership to a multisig wallet. 

## Motivation

Security has become a growing concern in DeFi as several high-profile exploits have caused some people to become more vocal about DeFi protocols. 
Switching to a multisig wallet will add an extra layer of security ahead of the more comprehensive solution we deploy in Phase One of the ProtocolDAO. 

## Specification


## Rationale

A multisig wallet will provide additional security without totally compromising the project's ability to iterate quickly.
