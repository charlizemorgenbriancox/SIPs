## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the SIP.-->

Add new flexible escrow API to the SNX Escrow contract.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.-->

The current SNX [RewardEscrow](https://contracts.synthetix.io/RewardEscrow) contract is limited only allowing the [FeePool](https://contracts.synthetix.io/FeePool) to escrow SNX rewards from the inflationary supply. 

It was not designed to be used as a general purpose escrow contract. New requirements include adding arbitary length escrow entries to be created by anyone as well as supporting the new terminal inflation and liquidation.

This will require a migration of all escrowed SNX and escrow entries from the current [RewardEscrow](https://contracts.synthetix.io/RewardEscrow) to new Escrow contract.

## Motivation

<!--The motivation is critical for SIPs that want to change Synthetix. It should clearly explain why the existing protocol specification is inadequate to address the problem that the SIP solves. SIP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->

### Current limitations of the `RewardEscrow` contract

1. Only escrows SNX for 12 months.
2. Only `FeePool` has the authority to create escrow entries.
3. The escrow table `checkAccountSchedule` only supports returning up to 5 years of escrow entries from the initial inflationary supply.
4. `Vest` can only be called by the owner of the SNX.
5. Cannot support liquidations of escrowed SNX for [sip-15](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-15).

### Desired features for a general `SynthetixEscrow` contract

1. Ability to add arbitrary escrow periods. e.g. 3 months to 2 years.
2. Public escrowing. Allows any EOA or any contract to escrow SNX. Allowing SNX to be escrowed for protocol contributors, investors and funds or contracts that escrow some sort of incentive similar to the Staking Rewards.
3. Update `checkAccountSchedule` to allow for terminal inflation and an unlimited escrow navigation through paging.
4. Allowing anyone to `vest` an accounts escrowed tokens allows Synthetix network keepers to help support SNX holders and supports the [Liquidation system](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-15) to vest an under collateralised accounts vest-able SNX to be paid to the liquidator.
5. If an account being [liquidated](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-15) does not have enough transferable SNX in their account and the system needs to liquidate escrowed SNX being used as collateral then reassign the escrow amounts to the liquidators account to vest.
TBD: Should the escrowed SNX be liquidated at a larger discount? or vested and transfered to the liquidator at the standard discount?

## Specification

<!--The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature.-->

```
interface ISynthetixEscrow {
    // Views
    
    // Updated to handle paging of 100 escrow entries at a time from a starting vesting index
    function checkAccountSchedule(address account, uint startIndex) public view returns (uint[100] memory) 

    // Mutative functions
    
    // Added escrowLength argument allowing any length of escrow period from 1 second to x years
    function appendVestingEntry(address account, uint quantity, uint escrowLength) external;
        
    function vest() external;
    
    // New function to allow any account vest another account
    function vestOnBehalf(address account) external;
}
```
### Migration
1. Synthetix will need to be upgraded to migrate the SNX to the new contract onchain.
2. During the migration `Vest` needs to be disabled or effectivly fail to ensure integrity of escrow entries and SNX balances beign migrated for all accounts.

## Test Cases

<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for SIPs but can be included with the implementation..-->
TBD

## Implementation

<!--The implementations must be completed before any SIP is given status "Implemented", but it need not be completed before the SIP is "Approved". While there is merit to the approach of reaching consensus on the specification and rationale before writing code, the principle of "rough consensus and running code" is still useful when it comes to resolving many discussions of API details.-->

## Configurable Values (Via SCCP)

<!--Please list all values configurable via SCCP under this implementation.-->
