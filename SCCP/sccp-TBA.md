## Simple Summary

Raise fees on synths sXTZ, sXRP, sLTC, sADA, sBCH, sBNB, sLINK and sBTC and their respective inverses to 50 bp from 30 bp.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the variable change proposed.-->

Increase fees to 50 bp on synths which are pushed with a 1% deviation threshold.

## Motivation

Analysis of on-chain data showed that front-running opportunities were more accessible after migration to chainlink price updates. Increasing fees to 50 bp on synths with a 1% deviation threshold push should help close that window.
