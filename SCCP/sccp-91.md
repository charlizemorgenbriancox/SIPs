## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the SCCP.-->

The current cap was configured to sUSD 50 million in [SCCP-88](https://sips.synthetix.io/SCCP/sccp-88) but has long been surpassed, this sccp proposed to increase it to sUSD 65 million given the increased demand for shorts from the increase in rewards.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the variable change proposed.-->

The cap can be increased to sUSD 65 million to allow more users to take loans and shorts.

## Motivation

<!--The motivation is critical for SCCPs that want to update variables within Synthetix. It should clearly explain why the existing variable is not incentive aligned. SCCP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->

The cap of sUSD 50 million has been reached. Given that we want to promote using the new shorting mechanism, increasing the cap is recommended.
