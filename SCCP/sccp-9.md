title: Redeploy iXTZ

## Simple Summary
<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the SCCP.-->
I propose re-enabling iXTZ (Inverse Tezos) with new limits. 

## Abstract
<!--A short (~200 word) description of the variable change proposed.-->
iXTZ allows traders to effectively take a short position on Tezos. Since it reached its lower limit as a result of Tezos appreciating in price recently, iXTZ has frozen. If people are to continue taking inverse positions on Tezos, a new iXTZ will need to be enabled. 

## Motivation
<!--The motivation is critical for SCCPs that want to update variables within Synthetix. It should clearly explain why the existing variable is not incentive aligned. SCCP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->
Inverse Tezos is one of our existing Synths, and our usual practice when an Inverse Synth gets frozen is to re-enable it in the next release.
