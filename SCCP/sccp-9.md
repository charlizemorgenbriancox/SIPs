## Simple Summary
I propose re-enabling iXTZ (Inverse Tezos) with new limits. 

## Abstract
iXTZ allows traders to effectively take a short position on Tezos. Since it reached its lower limit as a result of Tezos appreciating in price recently, iXTZ has frozen. If people are to continue taking inverse positions on Tezos, a new iXTZ will need to be enabled. 

## Motivation
Inverse Tezos is one of our existing Synths, and our usual practice when an Inverse Synth gets frozen is to re-enable it in the next release.
